## 🤔 What is Spec-Driven Development?

Spec-Driven Development **flips the script** on traditional software development. For decades, code has been king — specifications were just scaffolding we built and discarded once the "real work" of coding began. Spec-Driven Development changes this: **specifications become executable**, directly generating working implementations rather than just guiding them.

## ⚡ Get Started

### 1. Install Specify CLI

Choose your preferred installation method:

#### Option 1: Persistent Installation (Recommended)

Install once and use everywhere. Pin a specific release tag for stability (check [Releases](https://github.com/github/spec-kit/releases) for the latest):

```bash
# Install a specific stable release (recommended — replace vX.Y.Z with the latest tag)
uv tool install specify-cli --from git+https://github.com/github/spec-kit.git@vX.Y.Z

# Or install latest from main (may include unreleased changes)
uv tool install specify-cli --from git+https://github.com/github/spec-kit.git
```

Then use the tool directly:

```bash
# Create new project
specify init <PROJECT_NAME>

# Or initialize in existing project
specify init . --ai claude
# or
specify init --here --ai claude

# Check installed tools
specify check
```

To upgrade Specify, see the [Upgrade Guide](./docs/upgrade.md) for detailed instructions. Quick upgrade:

```bash
uv tool install specify-cli --force --from git+https://github.com/github/spec-kit.git@vX.Y.Z
```

#### Option 2: One-time Usage

Run directly without installing:

```bash
# Create new project (pinned to a stable release — replace vX.Y.Z with the latest tag)
uvx --from git+https://github.com/github/spec-kit.git@vX.Y.Z specify init <PROJECT_NAME>

# Or initialize in existing project
uvx --from git+https://github.com/github/spec-kit.git@vX.Y.Z specify init . --ai claude
# or
uvx --from git+https://github.com/github/spec-kit.git@vX.Y.Z specify init --here --ai claude
```

**Benefits of persistent installation:**

- Tool stays installed and available in PATH
- No need to create shell aliases
- Better tool management with `uv tool list`, `uv tool upgrade`, `uv tool uninstall`
- Cleaner shell configuration

#### Option 3: Enterprise / Air-Gapped Installation

If your environment blocks access to PyPI or GitHub, see the [Enterprise / Air-Gapped Installation](./docs/installation.md#enterprise--air-gapped-installation) guide for step-by-step instructions on using `pip download` to create portable, OS-specific wheel bundles on a connected machine.

### 2. Establish project principles

Launch your AI assistant in the project directory. Most agents expose spec-kit as `/speckit.*` slash commands; Codex CLI in skills mode uses `$speckit-*` instead.

Use the **`/speckit.constitution`** command to create your project's governing principles and development guidelines that will guide all subsequent development.

```bash
/speckit.constitution Create principles focused on code quality, testing standards, user experience consistency, and performance requirements
```

### 3. Create the spec

Use the **`/speckit.specify`** command to describe what you want to build. Focus on the **what** and **why**, not the tech stack.

```bash
/speckit.specify Build an application that can help me organize my photos in separate photo albums. Albums are grouped by date and can be re-organized by dragging and dropping on the main page. Albums are never in other nested albums. Within each album, photos are previewed in a tile-like interface.
```

### 4. Create a technical implementation plan

Use the **`/speckit.plan`** command to provide your tech stack and architecture choices.

```bash
/speckit.plan The application uses Vite with minimal number of libraries. Use vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as much as possible. Images are not uploaded anywhere and metadata is stored in a local SQLite database.
```

### 5. Break down into tasks

Use **`/speckit.tasks`** to create an actionable task list from your implementation plan.

```bash
/speckit.tasks
```

### 6. Execute implementation

Use **`/speckit.implement`** to execute all tasks and build your feature according to the plan.

```bash
/speckit.implement
```

For detailed step-by-step instructions, see our [comprehensive guide](./spec-driven.md).

# Spec Kit Extensions

Extension system for [Spec Kit](https://github.com/github/spec-kit) - add new functionality without bloating the core framework.

## Extension Catalogs

Spec Kit provides two catalog files with different purposes:

### Your Catalog (`catalog.json`)

- **Purpose**: Default upstream catalog of extensions used by the Spec Kit CLI
- **Default State**: Empty by design in the upstream project - you or your organization populate a fork/copy with extensions you trust
- **Location (upstream)**: `extensions/catalog.json` in the GitHub-hosted spec-kit repo
- **CLI Default**: The `specify extension` commands use the upstream catalog URL by default, unless overridden
- **Org Catalog**: Point `SPECKIT_CATALOG_URL` at your organization's fork or hosted catalog JSON to use it instead of the upstream default
- **Customization**: Copy entries from the community catalog into your org catalog, or add your own extensions directly

**Example override:**
```bash
# Override the default upstream catalog with your organization's catalog
export SPECKIT_CATALOG_URL="https://your-org.com/spec-kit/catalog.json"
specify extension search  # Now uses your organization's catalog instead of the upstream default
```

### Community Reference Catalog (`catalog.community.json`)

- **Purpose**: Browse available community-contributed extensions
- **Status**: Active - contains extensions submitted by the community
- **Location**: `extensions/catalog.community.json`
- **Usage**: Reference catalog for discovering available extensions
- **Submission**: Open to community contributions via Pull Request

**How It Works:**

## Making Extensions Available

You control which extensions your team can discover and install:

### Option 1: Curated Catalog (Recommended for Organizations)

Populate your `catalog.json` with approved extensions:

1. **Discover** extensions from various sources:
   - Browse `catalog.community.json` for community extensions
   - Find private/internal extensions in your organization's repos
   - Discover extensions from trusted third parties
2. **Review** extensions and choose which ones you want to make available
3. **Add** those extension entries to your own `catalog.json`
4. **Team members** can now discover and install them:
   - `specify extension search` shows your curated catalog
   - `specify extension add <name>` installs from your catalog

**Benefits**: Full control over available extensions, team consistency, organizational approval workflow

**Example**: Copy an entry from `catalog.community.json` to your `catalog.json`, then your team can discover and install it by name.

### Option 2: Direct URLs (For Ad-hoc Use)

Skip catalog curation - team members install directly using URLs:

```bash
specify extension add --from https://github.com/org/spec-kit-ext/archive/refs/tags/v1.0.0.zip
```

**Benefits**: Quick for one-off testing or private extensions

**Tradeoff**: Extensions installed this way won't appear in `specify extension search` for other team members unless you also add them to your `catalog.json`.

## Available Community Extensions

See the [Community Extensions](../README.md#-community-extensions) section in the main README for the full list of available community-contributed extensions.

For the raw catalog data, see [`catalog.community.json`](catalog.community.json).


## Adding Your Extension

### Submission Process

To add your extension to the community catalog:

1. **Prepare your extension** following the [Extension Development Guide](EXTENSION-DEVELOPMENT-GUIDE.md)
2. **Create a GitHub release** for your extension
3. **Submit a Pull Request** that:
   - Adds your extension to `extensions/catalog.community.json`
   - Updates this README with your extension in the Available Extensions table
4. **Wait for review** - maintainers will review and merge if criteria are met

See the [Extension Publishing Guide](EXTENSION-PUBLISHING-GUIDE.md) for detailed step-by-step instructions.

### Submission Checklist

Before submitting, ensure:

- ✅ Valid `extension.yml` manifest
- ✅ Complete README with installation and usage instructions
- ✅ LICENSE file included
- ✅ GitHub release created with semantic version (e.g., v1.0.0)
- ✅ Extension tested on a real project
- ✅ All commands working as documented

## Installing Extensions
Once extensions are available (either in your catalog or via direct URL), install them:

```bash
# From your curated catalog (by name)
specify extension search                  # See what's in your catalog
specify extension add <extension-name>    # Install by name

# Direct from URL (bypasses catalog)
specify extension add --from https://github.com/<org>/<repo>/archive/refs/tags/<version>.zip

# List installed extensions
specify extension list
```

For more information, see the [Extension User Guide](EXTENSION-USER-GUIDE.md).

```

### File: presets\README.md
```md
# Presets

Presets are stackable, priority-ordered collections of template and command overrides for Spec Kit. They let you customize both the artifacts produced by the Spec-Driven Development workflow (specs, plans, tasks, checklists, constitutions) and the commands that guide the LLM in creating them — without forking or modifying core files.

## How It Works

When Spec Kit needs a template (e.g. `spec-template`), it walks a resolution stack:

1. `.specify/templates/overrides/` — project-local one-off overrides
2. `.specify/presets/<preset-id>/templates/` — installed presets (sorted by priority)
3. `.specify/extensions/<ext-id>/templates/` — extension-provided templates
4. `.specify/templates/` — core templates shipped with Spec Kit

If no preset is installed, core templates are used — exactly the same behavior as before presets existed.

Template resolution happens **at runtime** — although preset files are copied into `.specify/presets/<id>/` during installation, Spec Kit walks the resolution stack on every template lookup rather than merging templates into a single location.

For detailed resolution and command registration flows, see [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md).

## Command Overrides

Presets can also override the commands that guide the SDD workflow. Templates define *what* gets produced (specs, plans, constitutions); commands define *how* the LLM produces them (the step-by-step instructions).

Unlike templates, command overrides are applied **at install time**. When a preset includes `type: "command"` entries, the commands are registered into all detected agent directories (`.claude/commands/`, `.gemini/commands/`, etc.) in the correct format (Markdown or TOML with appropriate argument placeholders). When the preset is removed, the registered commands are cleaned up.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Search available presets
specify preset search

# Install a preset from the catalog
specify preset add healthcare-compliance

# Install from a local directory (for development)
specify preset add --dev ./my-preset

# Install with a specific priority (lower = higher precedence)
specify preset add healthcare-compliance --priority 5

# List installed presets
specify preset list

# See which template a name resolves to
specify preset resolve spec-template

# Get detailed info about a preset
specify preset info healthcare-compliance

# Remove a preset
specify preset remove healthcare-compliance
```

## Stacking Presets

Multiple presets can be installed simultaneously. The `--priority` flag controls which one wins when two presets provide the same template (lower number = higher precedence):

```bash
specify preset add enterprise-safe --priority 10      # base layer
specify preset add healthcare-compliance --priority 5  # overrides enterprise-safe
specify preset add pm-workflow --priority 1            # overrides everything
```

Presets **override**, they don't merge. If two presets both provide `spec-template`, the one with the lowest priority number wins entirely.

## Catalog Management

Presets are discovered through catalogs. By default, Spec Kit uses the official and community catalogs:

```bash
# List active catalogs
specify preset catalog list

# Add a custom catalog
specify preset catalog add https://example.com/catalog.json --name my-org --install-allowed

# Remove a catalog
specify preset catalog remove my-org
```

## Creating a Preset

See [scaffold/](scaffold/) for a scaffold you can copy to create your own preset.

1. Copy `scaffold/` to a new directory
2. Edit `preset.yml` with your preset's metadata
3. Add or replace templates in `templates/`
4. Test locally with `specify preset add --dev .`
5. Verify with `specify preset resolve spec-template`

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `SPECKIT_PRESET_CATALOG_URL` | Override the catalog URL (replaces all defaults) |

## Configuration Files

| File | Scope | Description |
|------|-------|-------------|
| `.specify/preset-catalogs.yml` | Project | Custom catalog stack for this project |
| `~/.specify/preset-catalogs.yml` | User | Custom catalog stack for all projects |

## Future Considerations

The following enhancements are under consideration for future releases:

- **Composition strategies** — Allow presets to declare a `strategy` per template instead of the default `replace`:

  | Type | `replace` | `prepend` | `append` | `wrap` |
  |------|-----------|-----------|----------|--------|
  | **template** | ✓ (default) | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
  | **command** | ✓ (default) | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
  | **script** | ✓ (default) | — | — | ✓ |

  For artifacts and commands (which are LLM directives), `wrap` would inject preset content before and after the core template using a `{CORE_TEMPLATE}` placeholder. For scripts, `wrap` would run custom logic before/after the core script via a `$CORE_SCRIPT` variable.
- **Script overrides** — Enable presets to provide alternative versions of core scripts (e.g. `create-new-feature.sh`) for workflow customization. A `strategy: "wrap"` option could allow presets to run custom logic before/after the core script without fully replacing it.

```

## About Spec Kit and Specify

**GitHub Spec Kit** is a comprehensive toolkit for implementing Spec-Driven Development (SDD) - a methodology that emphasizes creating clear specifications before implementation. The toolkit includes templates, scripts, and workflows that guide development teams through a structured approach to building software.

**Specify CLI** is the command-line interface that bootstraps projects with the Spec Kit framework. It sets up the necessary directory structures, templates, and AI agent integrations to support the Spec-Driven Development workflow.

The toolkit supports multiple AI coding assistants, allowing teams to use their preferred tools while maintaining consistent project structure and development practices.

## Adding New Agent Support

This section explains how to add support for new AI agents/assistants to the Specify CLI. Use this guide as a reference when integrating new AI tools into the Spec-Driven Development workflow.

### Overview

Specify supports multiple AI agents by generating agent-specific command files and directory structures when initializing projects. Each agent has its own conventions for:

- **Command file formats** (Markdown, TOML, etc.)
- **Directory structures** (`.claude/commands/`, `.windsurf/workflows/`, etc.)
- **Command invocation patterns** (slash commands, CLI tools, etc.)
- **Argument passing conventions** (`$ARGUMENTS`, `{{args}}`, etc.)

### Step-by-Step Integration Guide

Follow these steps to add a new agent (using a hypothetical new agent as an example):

#### 1. Add to AGENT_CONFIG

**IMPORTANT**: Use the actual CLI tool name as the key, not a shortened version.

Add the new agent to the `AGENT_CONFIG` dictionary in `src/specify_cli/__init__.py`. This is the **single source of truth** for all agent metadata:

```python
AGENT_CONFIG = {
    # ... existing agents ...
    "new-agent-cli": {  # Use the ACTUAL CLI tool name (what users type in terminal)
        "name": "New Agent Display Name",
        "folder": ".newagent/",  # Directory for agent files
        "commands_subdir": "commands",  # Subdirectory name for command files (default: "commands")
        "install_url": "https://example.com/install",  # URL for installation docs (or None if IDE-based)
        "requires_cli": True,  # True if CLI tool required, False for IDE-based agents
    },
}
```

**Key Design Principle**: The dictionary key should match the actual executable name that users install. For example:

- ✅ Use `"cursor-agent"` because the CLI tool is literally called `cursor-agent`
- ❌ Don't use `"cursor"` as a shortcut if the tool is `cursor-agent`

This eliminates the need for special-case mappings throughout the codebase.

**Field Explanations**:

- `name`: Human-readable display name shown to users
- `folder`: Directory where agent-specific files are stored (relative to project root)
- `commands_subdir`: Subdirectory name within the agent folder where command/prompt files are stored (default: `"commands"`)
  - Most agents use `"commands"` (e.g., `.claude/commands/`)
  - Some agents use alternative names: `"agents"` (copilot), `"workflows"` (windsurf, kilocode), `"prompts"` (codex, kiro-cli, pi), `"command"` (opencode - singular)
  - This field enables `--ai-skills` to locate command templates correctly for skill generation
- `install_url`: Installation documentation URL (set to `None` for IDE-based agents)
- `requires_cli`: Whether the agent requires a CLI tool check during initialization

#### 2. Update CLI Help Text

Update the `--ai` parameter help text in the `init()` command to include the new agent:

```python
ai_assistant: str = typer.Option(None, "--ai", help="AI assistant to use: claude, gemini, copilot, cursor-agent, qwen, opencode, codex, windsurf, kilocode, auggie, codebuddy, new-agent-cli, or kiro-cli"),
```

Also update any function docstrings, examples, and error messages that list available agents.

#### 3. Update README Documentation

Update the **Supported AI Agents** section in `README.md` to include the new agent:

- Add the new agent to the table with appropriate support level (Full/Partial)
- Include the agent's official website link
- Add any relevant notes about the agent's implementation
- Ensure the table formatting remains aligned and consistent

#### 4. Update Release Package Script

Modify `.github/workflows/scripts/create-release-packages.sh`:

##### Add to ALL_AGENTS array

```bash
ALL_AGENTS=(claude gemini copilot cursor-agent qwen opencode windsurf kiro-cli)
```

##### Add case statement for directory structure

```bash
case $agent in
  # ... existing cases ...
  windsurf)
    mkdir -p "$base_dir/.windsurf/workflows"
    generate_commands windsurf md "\$ARGUMENTS" "$base_dir/.windsurf/workflows" "$script" ;;
esac
```

#### 4. Update GitHub Release Script

Modify `.github/workflows/scripts/create-github-release.sh` to include the new agent's packages:

```bash
gh release create "$VERSION" \
  # ... existing packages ...
  .genreleases/spec-kit-template-windsurf-sh-"$VERSION".zip \
  .genreleases/spec-kit-template-windsurf-ps-"$VERSION".zip \
  # Add new agent packages here
```

#### 5. Update Agent Context Scripts

##### Bash script (`scripts/bash/update-agent-context.sh`)

Add file variable:

```bash
WINDSURF_FILE="$REPO_ROOT/.windsurf/rules/specify-rules.md"
```

Add to case statement:

```bash
case "$AGENT_TYPE" in
  # ... existing cases ...
  windsurf) update_agent_file "$WINDSURF_FILE" "Windsurf" ;;
  "")
    # ... existing checks ...
    [ -f "$WINDSURF_FILE" ] && update_agent_file "$WINDSURF_FILE" "Windsurf";
    # Update default creation condition
    ;;
esac
```

##### PowerShell script (`scripts/powershell/update-agent-context.ps1`)

Add file variable:

```powershell
$windsurfFile = Join-Path $repoRoot '.windsurf/rules/specify-rules.md'
```

Add to switch statement:

```powershell
switch ($AgentType) {
    # ... existing cases ...
    'windsurf' { Update-AgentFile $windsurfFile 'Windsurf' }
    '' {
        foreach ($pair in @(
            # ... existing pairs ...
            @{file=$windsurfFile; name='Windsurf'}
        )) {
            if (Test-Path $pair.file) { Update-AgentFile $pair.file $pair.name }
        }
        # Update default creation condition
    }
}
```

#### 6. Update CLI Tool Checks (Optional)

For agents that require CLI tools, add checks in the `check()` command and agent validation:

```python
# In check() command
tracker.add("windsurf", "Windsurf IDE (optional)")
windsurf_ok = check_tool_for_tracker("windsurf", "https://windsurf.com/", tracker)

# In init validation (only if CLI tool required)
elif selected_ai == "windsurf":
    if not check_tool("windsurf", "Install from: https://windsurf.com/"):
        console.print("[red]Error:[/red] Windsurf CLI is required for Windsurf projects")
        agent_tool_missing = True
```

**Note**: CLI tool checks are now handled automatically based on the `requires_cli` field in AGENT_CONFIG. No additional code changes needed in the `check()` or `init()` commands - they automatically loop through AGENT_CONFIG and check tools as needed.

## Important Design Decisions

### Using Actual CLI Tool Names as Keys

**CRITICAL**: When adding a new agent to AGENT_CONFIG, always use the **actual executable name** as the dictionary key, not a shortened or convenient version.

**Why this matters:**

- The `check_tool()` function uses `shutil.which(tool)` to find executables in the system PATH
- If the key doesn't match the actual CLI tool name, you'll need special-case mappings throughout the codebase
- This creates unnecessary complexity and maintenance burden

**Example - The Cursor Lesson:**

❌ **Wrong approach** (requires special-case mapping):

```python
AGENT_CONFIG = {
    "cursor": {  # Shorthand that doesn't match the actual tool
        "name": "Cursor",
        # ...
    }
}

# Then you need special cases everywhere:
cli_tool = agent_key
if agent_key == "cursor":
    cli_tool = "cursor-agent"  # Map to the real tool name
```

✅ **Correct approach** (no mapping needed):

```python
AGENT_CONFIG = {
    "cursor-agent": {  # Matches the actual executable name
        "name": "Cursor",
        # ...
    }
}

# No special cases needed - just use agent_key directly!
```

**Benefits of this approach:**

- Eliminates special-case logic scattered throughout the codebase
- Makes the code more maintainable and easier to understand
- Reduces the chance of bugs when adding new agents
- Tool checking "just works" without additional mappings

#### 7. Update Devcontainer files (Optional)

For agents that have VS Code extensions or require CLI installation, update the devcontainer configuration files:

##### VS Code Extension-based Agents

For agents available as VS Code extensions, add them to `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json`:

```json
{
  "customizations": {
    "vscode": {
      "extensions": [
        // ... existing extensions ...
        // [New Agent Name]
        "[New Agent Extension ID]"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

##### CLI-based Agents

For agents that require CLI tools, add installation commands to `.devcontainer/post-create.sh`:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Existing installations...

echo -e "\n🤖 Installing [New Agent Name] CLI..."
# run_command "npm install -g [agent-cli-package]@latest" # Example for node-based CLI
# or other installation instructions (must be non-interactive and compatible with Linux Debian "Trixie" or later)...
echo "✅ Done"

```

**Quick Tips:**

- **Extension-based agents**: Add to the `extensions` array in `devcontainer.json`
- **CLI-based agents**: Add installation scripts to `post-create.sh`
- **Hybrid agents**: May require both extension and CLI installation
- **Test thoroughly**: Ensure installations work in the devcontainer environment

## Agent Categories

### CLI-Based Agents

Require a command-line tool to be installed:

- **Claude Code**: `claude` CLI
- **Gemini CLI**: `gemini` CLI
- **Cursor**: `cursor-agent` CLI
- **Qwen Code**: `qwen` CLI
- **opencode**: `opencode` CLI
- **Junie**: `junie` CLI
- **Kiro CLI**: `kiro-cli` CLI
- **CodeBuddy CLI**: `codebuddy` CLI
- **Qoder CLI**: `qodercli` CLI
- **Amp**: `amp` CLI
- **SHAI**: `shai` CLI
- **Tabnine CLI**: `tabnine` CLI
- **Kimi Code**: `kimi` CLI
- **Pi Coding Agent**: `pi` CLI

### IDE-Based Agents

Work within integrated development environments:

- **GitHub Copilot**: Built into VS Code/compatible editors
- **Windsurf**: Built into Windsurf IDE
- **IBM Bob**: Built into IBM Bob IDE

## Command File Formats

### Markdown Format

Used by: Claude, Cursor, opencode, Windsurf, Junie, Kiro CLI, Amp, SHAI, IBM Bob, Kimi Code, Qwen, Pi

**Standard format:**

```markdown
---
description: "Command description"
---

Command content with {SCRIPT} and $ARGUMENTS placeholders.
```

**GitHub Copilot Chat Mode format:**

```markdown
---
description: "Command description"
mode: speckit.command-name
---

Command content with {SCRIPT} and $ARGUMENTS placeholders.
```

### TOML Format

Used by: Gemini, Tabnine

```toml
description = "Command description"

prompt = """
Command content with {SCRIPT} and {{args}} placeholders.
"""
```

## Directory Conventions

- **CLI agents**: Usually `.<agent-name>/commands/`
- **Skills-based exceptions**:
  - Codex: `.agents/skills/` (skills, invoked as `$speckit-<command>`)
- **Prompt-based exceptions**:
  - Kiro CLI: `.kiro/prompts/`
  - Pi: `.pi/prompts/`
- **IDE agents**: Follow IDE-specific patterns:
  - Copilot: `.github/agents/`
  - Cursor: `.cursor/commands/`
  - Windsurf: `.windsurf/workflows/`

## Argument Patterns

Different agents use different argument placeholders:

- **Markdown/prompt-based**: `$ARGUMENTS`
- **TOML-based**: `{{args}}`
- **Script placeholders**: `{SCRIPT}` (replaced with actual script path)
- **Agent placeholders**: `__AGENT__` (replaced with agent name)

## Testing New Agent Integration

1. **Build test**: Run package creation script locally
2. **CLI test**: Test `spe
