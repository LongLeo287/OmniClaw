## Installation

There are mainly 2 ways of installing Vane - With Docker, Without Docker. Using Docker is highly recommended.

### Getting Started with Docker (Recommended)

Vane can be easily run using Docker. Simply run the following command:

```bash
docker run -d -p 3000:3000 -v vane-data:/home/vane/data --name vane itzcrazykns1337/vane:latest
```

This will pull and start the Vane container with the bundled SearxNG search engine. Once running, open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000. You can then configure your settings (API keys, models, etc.) directly in the setup screen.

**Note**: The image includes both Vane and SearxNG, so no additional setup is required. The `-v` flags create persistent volumes for your data and uploaded files.

#### Using Vane with Your Own SearxNG Instance

If you already have SearxNG running, you can use the slim version of Vane:

```bash
docker run -d -p 3000:3000 -e SEARXNG_API_URL=http://your-searxng-url:8080 -v vane-data:/home/vane/data --name vane itzcrazykns1337/vane:slim-latest
```

**Important**: Make sure your SearxNG instance has:

- JSON format enabled in the settings
- Wolfram Alpha search engine enabled

Replace `http://your-searxng-url:8080` with your actual SearxNG URL. Then configure your AI provider settings in the setup screen at http://localhost:3000.

#### Advanced Setup (Building from Source)

If you prefer to build from source or need more control:

1. Ensure Docker is installed and running on your system.
2. Clone the Vane repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ItzCrazyKns/Vane.git
   ```

3. After cloning, navigate to the directory containing the project files.

4. Build and run using Docker:

   ```bash
   docker build -t vane .
   docker run -d -p 3000:3000 -v vane-data:/home/vane/data --name vane vane
   ```

5. Access Vane at http://localhost:3000 and configure your settings in the setup screen.

**Note**: After the containers are built, you can start Vane directly from Docker without having to open a terminal.

### Non-Docker Installation

1. Install SearXNG and allow `JSON` format in the SearXNG settings. Make sure Wolfram Alpha search engine is also enabled.
2. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ItzCrazyKns/Vane.git
   cd Vane
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm i
   ```

4. Build the application:

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

5. Start the application:

   ```bash
   npm run start
   ```

6. Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 to complete the setup and configure your settings (API keys, models, SearxNG URL, etc.) in the setup screen.

**Note**: Using Docker is recommended as it simplifies the setup process, especially for managing environment variables and dependencies.

See the [installation documentation](https://github.com/ItzCrazyKns/Vane/tree/master/docs/installation) for more information like updating, etc.

### Troubleshooting

#### Local OpenAI-API-Compliant Servers

If Vane tells you that you haven't configured any chat model providers, ensure that:

1. Your server is running on `0.0.0.0` (not `127.0.0.1`) and on the same port you put in the API URL.
2. You have specified the correct model name loaded by your local LLM server.
3. You have specified the correct API key, or if one is not defined, you have put _something_ in the API key field and not left it empty.

#### Ollama Connection Errors

If you're encountering an Ollama connection error, it is likely due to the backend being unable to connect to Ollama's API. To fix this issue you can:

1. **Check your Ollama API URL:** Ensure that the API URL is correctly set in the settings menu.
2. **Update API URL Based on OS:**

   - **Windows:** Use `http://host.docker.internal:11434`
   - **Mac:** Use `http://host.docker.internal:11434`
   - **Linux:** Use `http://<private_ip_of_host>:11434`

   Adjust the port number if you're using a different one.

3. **Linux Users - Expose Ollama to Network:**

   - Inside `/etc/systemd/system/ollama.service`, you need to add `Environment="OLLAMA_HOST=0.0.0.0:11434"`. (Change the port number if you are using a different one.) Then reload the systemd manager configuration with `systemctl daemon-reload`, and restart Ollama by `systemctl restart ollama`. For more information see [Ollama docs](https://github.com/ollama/ollama/blob/main/docs/faq.md#setting-environment-variables-on-linux)

   - Ensure that the port (default is 11434) is not blocked by your firewall.

#### Lemonade Connection Errors

If you're encountering a Lemonade connection error, it is likely due to the backend being unable to connect to Lemonade's API. To fix this issue you can:

1. **Check your Lemonade API URL:** Ensure that the API URL is correctly set in the settings menu.
2. **Update API URL Based on OS:**

   - **Windows:** Use `http://host.docker.internal:8000`
   - **Mac:** Use `http://host.docker.internal:8000`
   - **Linux:** Use `http://<private_ip_of_host>:8000`

   Adjust the port number if you're using a different one.

3. **Ensure Lemonade Server is Running:**

   - Make sure your Lemonade server is running and accessible on the configured port (default is 8000).
   - Verify that Lemonade is configured to accept connections from all interfaces (`0.0.0.0`), not just localhost (`127.0.0.1`).
   - Ensure that the port (default is 8000) is not blocked by your firewall.

## Using as a Search Engine

If you wish to use Vane as an alternative to traditional search engines like Google or Bing, or if you want to add a shortcut for quick access from your browser's search bar, follow these steps:

1. Open your browser's settings.
2. Navigate to the 'Search Engines' section.
3. Add a new site search with the following URL: `http://localhost:3000/?q=%s`. Replace `localhost` with your IP address or domain name, and `3000` with the port number if Vane is not hosted locally.
4. Click the add button. Now, you can use Vane directly from your browser's search bar.

## Using Vane's API

Vane also provides an API for developers looking to integrate its powerful search engine into their own applications. You can run searches, use multiple models and get answers to your queries.

For more details, check out the full documentation [here](https://github.com/ItzCrazyKns/Vane/tree/master/docs/API/SEARCH.md).

## Expose Vane to network

Vane runs on Next.js and handles all API requests. It works right away on the same network and stays accessible even with port forwarding.

# Vane Architecture

Vane is a Next.js application that combines an AI chat experience with search.

For a high level flow, see [WORKING.md](WORKING.md). For deeper implementation details, see [CONTRIBUTING.md](../../CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Key components

1. **User Interface**

   - A web based UI that lets users chat, search, and view citations.

2. **API Routes**

   - `POST /api/chat` powers the chat UI.
   - `POST /api/search` provides a programmatic search endpoint.
   - `GET /api/providers` lists available providers and model keys.

3. **Agents and Orchestration**

   - The system classifies the question first.
   - It can run research and widgets in parallel.
   - It generates the final answer and includes citations.

4. **Search Backend**

   - A meta search backend is used to fetch relevant web results when research is enabled.

5. **LLMs (Large Language Models)**

   - Used for classification, writing answers, and producing citations.

6. **Embedding Models**

   - Used for semantic search over user uploaded files.

7. **Storage**
   - Chats and messages are stored so conversations can be reloaded.

# How to Contribute to Vane

Thanks for your interest in contributing to Vane! Your help makes this project better. This guide explains how to contribute effectively.

Vane is a modern AI chat application with advanced search capabilities.

## Project Structure

Vane's codebase is organized as follows:

- **UI Components and Pages**:
  - **Components (`src/components`)**: Reusable UI components.
  - **Pages and Routes (`src/app`)**: Next.js app directory structure with page components.
    - Main app routes include: home (`/`), chat (`/c`), discover (`/discover`), and library (`/library`).
  - **API Routes (`src/app/api`)**: Server endpoints implemented with Next.js route handlers.
- **Backend Logic (`src/lib`)**: Contains all the backend functionality including search, database, and API logic.
  - The search system lives in `src/lib/agents/search`.
  - The search pipeline is split into classification, research, widgets, and writing.
  - Database functionality is in `src/lib/db`.
  - Chat model and embedding model providers are in `src/lib/models/providers`, and models are loaded via `src/lib/models/registry.ts`.
  - Prompt templates are in `src/lib/prompts`.
  - SearXNG integration is in `src/lib/searxng.ts`.
  - Upload search lives in `src/lib/uploads`.

### Where to make changes

If you are not sure where to start, use this section as a map.

- **Search behavior and reasoning**

  - `src/lib/agents/search` contains the core chat and search pipeline.
  - `classifier.ts` decides whether research is needed and what should run.
  - `researcher/` gathers information in the background.

- **Add or change a search capability**

  - Research tools (web, academic, discussions, uploads, scraping) live in `src/lib/agents/search/researcher/actions`.
  - Tools are registered in `src/lib/agents/search/researcher/actions/index.ts`.

- **Add or change widgets**

  - Widgets live in `src/lib/agents/search/widgets`.
  - Widgets run in parallel with research and show structured results in the UI.

- **Model integrations**

  - Providers live in `src/lib/models/providers`.
  - Add new providers there and wire them into the model registry so they show up in the app.

- **Architecture docs**
  - High level overview: `docs/architecture/README.md`
  - High level flow: `docs/architecture/WORKING.md`

## API Documentation

Vane includes API documentation for programmatic access.

- **Search API**: For detailed documentation, see `docs/API/SEARCH.md`.

## Setting Up Your Environment

Before diving into coding, setting up your local environment is key. Here's what you need to do:

1. Run `npm install` to install all dependencies.
2. Use `npm run dev` to start the application in development mode.
3. Open http://localhost:3000 and complete the setup in the UI (API keys, models, search backend URL, etc.).

Database migrations are applied automatically on startup.

For full installation options (Docker and non Docker), see the installation guide in the repository README.

**Please note**: Docker configurations are present for setting up production environments, whereas `npm run dev` is used for development purposes.

## Coding and Contribution Practices

Before committing changes:

1. Ensure that your code functions correctly by thorough testing.
2. Always run `npm run format:write` to format your code according to the project's coding standards. This helps maintain consistency and code quality.
3. We currently do not have a code of conduct, but it is in the works. In the meantime, please be mindful of how you engage with the project and its community.

Following these steps will help maintain the integrity of Vane's codebase and facilitate a smoother integration of your valuable contributions. Thank you for your support and commitment to improving Vane.

# Vane Search API Documentation

## Overview

Vane's Search API makes it easy to use our AI-powered search engine. You can run different types of searches, pick the models you want to use, and get the most recent info. Follow the following headings to learn more about Vane's search API.

## Endpoints

### Get Available Providers and Models

Before making search requests, you'll need to get the available providers and their models.

#### **GET** `/api/providers`

**Full URL**: `http://localhost:3000/api/providers`

Returns a list of all active providers with their available chat and embedding models.

**Response Example:**

```json
{
  "providers": [
    {
      "id": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
      "name": "OpenAI",
      "chatModels": [
        {
          "name": "GPT 4 Omni Mini",
          "key": "gpt-4o-mini"
        },
        {
          "name": "GPT 4 Omni",
          "key": "gpt-4o"
        }
      ],
      "embeddingModels": [
        {
          "name": "Text Embedding 3 Large",
          "key": "text-embedding-3-large"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

Use the `id` field as the `providerId` and the `key` field from the models arrays when making search requests.

### Search Query

#### **POST** `/api/search`

**Full URL**: `http://localhost:3000/api/search`

**Note**: Replace `localhost:3000` with your Vane instance URL if running on a different host or port

### Request

The API accepts a JSON object in the request body, where you define the enabled search `sources`, chat models, embedding models, and your query.

#### Request Body Structure

```json
{
  "chatModel": {
    "providerId": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
    "key": "gpt-4o-mini"
  },
  "embeddingModel": {
    "providerId": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
    "key": "text-embedding-3-large"
  },
  "optimizationMode": "speed",
  "sources": ["web"],
  "query": "What is Vane",
  "history": [
    ["human", "Hi, how are you?"],
    ["assistant", "I am doing well, how can I help you today?"]
  ],
  "systemInstructions": "Focus on providing technical details about Vane's architecture.",
  "stream": false
}
```

**Note**: The `providerId` must be a valid UUID obtained from the `/api/providers` endpoint. The example above uses a sample UUID for demonstration.

### Request Parameters

- **`chatModel`** (object, required): Defines the chat model to be used for the query. To get available providers and models, send a GET request to `http://localhost:3000/api/providers`.

  - `providerId` (string): The UUID of the provider. You can get this from the `/api/providers` endpoint response.
  - `key` (string): The model key/identifier (e.g., `gpt-4o-mini`, `llama3.1:latest`). Use the `key` value from the provider's `chatModels` array, not the display name.

- **`embeddingModel`** (object, required): Defines the embedding model for similarity-based searching. To get available providers and models, send a GET request to `http://localhost:3000/api/providers`.

  - `providerId` (string): The UUID of the embedding provider. You can get this from the `/api/providers` endpoint response.
  - `key` (string): The embedding model key (e.g., `text-embedding-3-large`, `nomic-embed-text`). Use the `key` value from the provider's `embeddingModels` array, not the display name.

- **`sources`** (array, required): Which search sources to enable. Available values:

  - `web`, `academic`, `discussions`.

- **`optimizationMode`** (string, optional): Specifies the optimization mode to control the balance between performance and quality. Available modes:

  - `speed`: Prioritize speed and return the fastest answer.
  - `balanced`: Provide a balanced answer with good speed and reasonable quality.
  - `quality`: Prioritize answer quality (may be slower).

- **`query`** (string, required): The search query or question.

- **`systemInstructions`** (string, optional): Custom instructions provided by the user to guide the AI's response. These instructions are treated as user preferences and have lower priority than the system's core instructions. For example, you can specify a particular writing style, format, or focus area.

- **`history`** (array, optional): An array of message pairs representing the conversation history. Each pair consists of a role (either 'human' or 'assistant') and the message content. This allows the system to use the context of the conversation to refine results. Example:

  ```json
  [
    ["human", "What is Vane?"],
    ["assistant", "Vane is an AI-powered search engine..."]
  ]
  ```

- **`stream`** (boolean, optional): When set to `true`, enables streaming responses. Default is `false`.

### Response

The response from the API includes both the final message and the sources used to generate that message.

#### Standard Response (stream: false)

```json
{
  "message": "Vane is an innovative, open-source AI-powered search engine designed to enhance the way users search for information online. Here are some key features and characteristics of Vane:\n\n- **AI-Powered Technology**: It utilizes advanced machine learning algorithms to not only retrieve information but also to understand the context and intent behind user queries, providing more relevant results [1][5].\n\n- **Open-Source**: Being open-source, Vane offers flexibility and transparency, allowing users to explore its functionalities without the constraints of proprietary software [3][10].",
  "sources": [
    {
      "content": "Vane is an innovative, open-source AI-powered search engine designed to enhance the way users search for information online.",
      "metadata": {
        "title": "What is Vane, and how does it function as an AI-powered search ...",
        "url": "https://askai.glarity.app/search/What-is-Vane--and-how-does-it-function-as-an-AI-powered-search-engine"
      }
    },
    {
      "content": "Vane is an open-source AI-powered search tool that dives deep into the internet to find precise answers.",
      "metadata": {
        "title": "Sahar Mor's Post",
        "url": "https://www.linkedin.com/posts/sahar-mor_a-new-open-source-project-called-vane-activity-7204489745668694016-ncja"
      }
    }
        ....
  ]
}
```

#### Streaming Response (stream: true)

When streaming is enabled, the API returns a stream of newline-delimited JSON objects using Server-Sent Events (SSE). Each line contains a complete, valid JSON object. The response has `Content-Type: text/event-stream`.

Example of streamed response objects:

```
{"type":"init","data":"Stream connected"}
{"type":"sources","data":[{"content":"...","metadata":{"title":"...","url":"..."}},...]}
{"type":"response","data":"Vane is an "}
{"type":"response","data":"innovative, open-source "}
{"type":"response","data":"AI-powered search engine..."}
{"type":"done"}
```

Clients should process each line as a separate JSON object. The different message types include:

- **`init`**: Initial connection message
- **`sources`**: All sources used for the response
- **`response`**: Chunks of the generated answer text
- **`done`**: Indicates the stream is complete

### Fields in the Response

- **`message`** (string): The search result, generated based on the query and enabled `sources`.
- **`sources`** (array): A list of sources that were used to generate the search result. Each source includes:
  - `content`: A snippet of the relevant content from the source.
  - `metadata`: Metadata about the source, including:
    - `title`: The title of the webpage.
    - `url`: The URL of the webpage.

### Error Handling

If an error occurs during the search process, the API will return an appropriate error message with an HTTP status code.

- **400**: If the request is malformed or missing required fields (e.g., no `sources` or `query`).
- **500**: If an internal server error occurs during the search.

```

# How Vane Works

This is a high level overview of how Vane answers a question.

If you want a component level overview, see [README.md](README.md).

If you want implementation details, see [CONTRIBUTING.md](../../CONTRIBUTING.md).

## What happens when you ask a question

When you send a message in the UI, the app calls `POST /api/chat`.

At a high level, we do three things:

1. Classify the question and decide what to do next.
2. Run research and widgets in parallel.
3. Write the final answer and include citations.

## Classification

Before searching or answering, we run a classification step.

This step decides things like:

- Whether we should do research for this question
- Whether we should show any widgets
- How to rewrite the question into a clearer standalone form

## Widgets

Widgets are small, structured helpers that can run alongside research.

Examples include weather, stocks, and simple calculations.

If a widget is relevant, we show it in the UI while the answer is still being generated.

Widgets are helpful context for the answer, but they are not part of what the model should cite.

## Research

If research is needed, we gather information in the background while widgets can run.

Depending on configuration, research may include web lookup and searching user uploaded files.

## Answer generation

Once we have enough context, the chat model generates the final response.

You can control the tradeoff between speed and quality using `optimizationMode`:

- `speed`
- `balanced`
- `quality`

## How citations work

We prompt the model to cite the references it used. The UI then renders those citations alongside the supporting links.

## Search API

If you are integrating Vane into another product, you can call `POST /api/search`.

It returns:

- `message`: the generated answer
- `sources`: supporting references used for the answer

You can also enable streaming by setting `stream: true`.

## Image and video search

Image and video search use separate endpoints (`POST /api/images` and `POST /api/videos`). We generate a focused query using the chat model, then fetch matching results from a search backend.
