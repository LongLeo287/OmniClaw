# NanoClaw

Personal Claude assistant. See [README.md](README.md) for philosophy and setup. See [docs/REQUIREMENTS.md](../../../core/security/QUARANTINE/vetted/repos/LobsterAI/spec/features/001_optimize_windows_startup/checklists/requirements.md) for architecture decisions.

## Quick Context

Single Node.js process with skill-based channel system. Channels (WhatsApp, Telegram, Slack, Discord, Gmail) are skills that self-register at startup. Messages route to Claude Agent SDK running in containers (Linux VMs). Each group has isolated filesystem and memory.

## Key Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `src/index.ts` | Orchestrator: state, message loop, agent invocation |
| `src/channels/registry.ts` | Channel registry (self-registration at startup) |
| `src/ipc.ts` | IPC watcher and task processing |
| `src/router.ts` | Message formatting and outbound routing |
| `src/config.ts` | Trigger pattern, paths, intervals |
| `src/container-runner.ts` | Spawns agent containers with mounts |
| `src/task-scheduler.ts` | Runs scheduled tasks |
| `src/db.ts` | SQLite operations |
| `groups/{name}/CLAUDE.md` | Per-group memory (isolated) |
| `container/skills/` | Skills loaded inside agent containers (browser, status, formatting) |

## Secrets / Credentials / Proxy (OneCLI)

API keys, secret keys, OAuth tokens, and auth credentials are managed by the OneCLI gateway — which handles secret injection into containers at request time, so no keys or tokens are ever passed to containers directly. Run `onecli --help`.

## Skills

Four types of skills exist in NanoClaw. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for the full taxonomy and guidelines.

- **Feature skills** — merge a `skill/*` branch to add capabilities (e.g. `/add-telegram`, `/add-slack`)
- **Utility skills** — ship code files alongside SKILL.md (e.g. `/claw`)
- **Operational skills** — instruction-only workflows, always on `main` (e.g. `/setup`, `/debug`)
- **Container skills** — loaded inside agent containers at runtime (`container/skills/`)

| Skill | When to Use |
|-------|-------------|
| `/setup` | First-time installation, authentication, service configuration |
| `/customize` | Adding channels, integrations, changing behavior |
| `/debug` | Container issues, logs, troubleshooting |
| `/update-nanoclaw` | Bring upstream NanoClaw updates into a customized install |
| `/init-onecli` | Install OneCLI Agent Vault and migrate `.env` credentials to it |
| `/qodo-pr-resolver` | Fetch and fix Qodo PR review issues interactively or in batch |
| `/get-qodo-rules` | Load org- and repo-level coding rules from Qodo before code tasks |

## Contributing

Before creating a PR, adding a skill, or preparing any contribution, you MUST read [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md). It covers accepted change types, the four skill types and their guidelines, SKILL.md format rules, PR requirements, and the pre-submission checklist (searching for existing PRs/issues, testing, description format).

## Development

Run commands directly—don't tell the user to run them.

```bash
npm run dev          # Run with hot reload
npm run build        # Compile TypeScript
./container/build.sh # Rebuild agent container
```

Service management:
```bash
# macOS (launchd)
launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.nanoclaw.plist
launchctl unload ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.nanoclaw.plist
launchctl kickstart -k gui/$(id -u)/com.nanoclaw  # restart

# Linux (systemd)
systemctl --user start nanoclaw
systemctl --user stop nanoclaw
systemctl --user restart nanoclaw
```

## Troubleshooting

**WhatsApp not connecting after upgrade:** WhatsApp is now a separate skill, not bundled in core. Run `/add-whatsapp` (or `npx tsx scripts/apply-skill.ts .claude/skills/add-whatsapp && npm run build`) to install it. Existing auth credentials and groups are preserved.

## Container Build Cache

The container buildkit caches the build context aggressively. `--no-cache` alone does NOT invalidate COPY steps — the builder's volume retains stale files. To force a truly clean rebuild, prune the builder then re-run `./container/build.sh`.
```

# Contributing

## Before You Start

1. **Check for existing work.** Search open PRs and issues before starting:
   ```bash
   gh pr list --repo qwibitai/nanoclaw --search "<your feature>"
   gh issue list --repo qwibitai/nanoclaw --search "<your feature>"
   ```
   If a related PR or issue exists, build on it rather than duplicating effort.

2. **Check alignment.** Read the [Philosophy section in README.md](README.md#philosophy). Source code changes should only be things 90%+ of users need. Skills can be more niche, but should still be useful beyond a single person's setup.

3. **One thing per PR.** Each PR should do one thing — one bug fix, one skill, one simplification. Don't mix unrelated changes in a single PR.

## Source Code Changes

**Accepted:** Bug fixes, security fixes, simplifications, reducing code.

**Not accepted:** Features, capabilities, compatibility, enhancements. These should be skills.

## Skills

NanoClaw uses [Claude Code skills](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/skills) — markdown files with optional supporting files that teach Claude how to do something. There are four types of skills in NanoClaw, each serving a different purpose.

### Why skills?

Every user should have clean and minimal code that does exactly what they need. Skills let users selectively add features to their fork without inheriting code for features they don't want.

### Skill types

#### 1. Feature skills (branch-based)

Add capabilities to NanoClaw by merging a git branch. The SKILL.md contains setup instructions; the actual code lives on a `skill/*` branch.

**Location:** `.claude/skills/` on `main` (instructions only), code on `skill/*` branch

**Examples:** `/add-telegram`, `/add-slack`, `/add-discord`, `/add-gmail`

**How they work:**
1. User runs `/add-telegram`
2. Claude follows the SKILL.md: fetches and merges the `skill/telegram` branch
3. Claude walks through interactive setup (env vars, bot creation, etc.)

**Contributing a feature skill:**
1. Fork `qwibitai/nanoclaw` and branch from `main`
2. Make the code changes (new files, modified source, updated `package.json`, etc.)
3. Add a SKILL.md in `.claude/skills/<name>/` with setup instructions — step 1 should be merging the branch
4. Open a PR. We'll create the `skill/<name>` branch from your work

See `/add-telegram` for a good example. See [docs/skills-as-branches.md](docs/skills-as-branches.md) for the full system design.

#### 2. Utility skills (with code files)

Standalone tools that ship code files alongside the SKILL.md. The SKILL.md tells Claude how to install the tool; the code lives in the skill directory itself (e.g. in a `scripts/` subfolder).

**Location:** `.claude/skills/<name>/` with supporting files

**Examples:** `/claw` (Python CLI in `scripts/claw`)

**Key difference from feature skills:** No branch merge needed. The code is self-contained in the skill directory and gets copied into place during installation.

**Guidelines:**
- Put code in separate files, not inline in the SKILL.md
- Use `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}` to reference files in the skill directory
- SKILL.md contains installation instructions, usage docs, and troubleshooting

#### 3. Operational skills (instruction-only)

Workflows and guides with no code changes. The SKILL.md is the entire skill — Claude follows the instructions to perform a task.

**Location:** `.claude/skills/` on `main`

**Examples:** `/setup`, `/debug`, `/customize`, `/update-nanoclaw`, `/update-skills`

**Guidelines:**
- Pure instructions — no code files, no branch merges
- Use `AskUserQuestion` for interactive prompts
- These stay on `main` and are always available to every user

#### 4. Container skills (agent runtime)

Skills that run inside the agent container, not on the host. These teach the container agent how to use tools, format output, or perform tasks. They are synced into each group's `.claude/skills/` directory when a container starts.

**Location:** `container/skills/<name>/`

**Examples:** `agent-browser` (web browsing), `capabilities` (/capabilities command), `status` (/status command), `slack-formatting` (Slack mrkdwn syntax)

**Key difference:** These are NOT invoked by the user on the host. They're loaded by Claude Code inside the container and influence how the agent behaves.

**Guidelines:**
- Follow the same SKILL.md + frontmatter format
- Use `allowed-tools` frontmatter to scope tool permissions
- Keep them focused — the agent's context window is shared across all container skills

### SKILL.md format

All skills use the [Claude Code skills standard](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/skills):

```markdown
---
name: my-skill
description: What this skill does and when to use it.
---

Instructions here...
```

**Rules:**
- Keep SKILL.md **under 500 lines** — move detail to separate reference files
- `name`: lowercase, alphanumeric + hyphens, max 64 chars
- `description`: required — Claude uses this to decide when to invoke the skill
- Put code in separate files, not inline in the markdown
- See the [skills standard](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/skills) for all available frontmatter fields

## Testing

Test your contribution on a fresh clone before submitting. For skills, run the skill end-to-end and verify it works.

## Pull Requests

### Before opening

1. **Link related issues.** If your PR resolves an open issue, include `Closes #123` in the description so it's auto-closed on merge.
2. **Test thoroughly.** Run the feature yourself. For skills, test on a fresh clone.
3. **Check the right box** in the PR template. Labels are auto-applied based on your selection:

| Checkbox | Label |
|----------|-------|
| Feature skill | `PR: Skill` + `PR: Feature` |
| Utility skill | `PR: Skill` |
| Operational/container skill | `PR: Skill` |
| Fix | `PR: Fix` |
| Simplification | `PR: Refactor` |
| Documentation | `PR: Docs` |

### PR description

Keep it concise. Remove any template sections that don't apply. The description should cover:

- **What** — what the PR adds or changes
- **Why** — the motivation
- **How it works** — brief explanation of the approach
- **How it was tested** — what you did to verify it works
- **Usage** — how the user invokes it (for skills)

Don't pad the description. A few clear sentences are better than lengthy paragraphs.
```

## Why I Built NanoClaw

[OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw) is an impressive project, but I wouldn't have been able to sleep if I had given complex software I didn't understand full access to my life. OpenClaw has nearly half a million lines of code, 53 config files, and 70+ dependencies. Its security is at the application level (allowlists, pairing codes) rather than true OS-level isolation. Everything runs in one Node process with shared memory.

NanoClaw provides that same core functionality, but in a codebase small enough to understand: one process and a handful of files. Claude agents run in their own Linux containers with filesystem isolation, not merely behind permission checks.

## Quick Start

```bash
gh repo fork qwibitai/nanoclaw --clone
cd nanoclaw
claude
```

<details>
<summary>Without GitHub CLI</summary>

1. Fork [qwibitai/nanoclaw](https://github.com/qwibitai/nanoclaw) on GitHub (click the Fork button)
2. `git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/nanoclaw.git`
3. `cd nanoclaw`
4. `claude`

</details>

Then run `/setup`. Claude Code handles everything: dependencies, authentication, container setup and service configuration.

> **Note:** Commands prefixed with `/` (like `/setup`, `/add-whatsapp`) are [Claude Code skills](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/skills). Type them inside the `claude` CLI prompt, not in your regular terminal. If you don't have Claude Code installed, get it at [claude.com/product/claude-code](https://claude.com/product/claude-code).

## Philosophy

**Small enough to understand.** One process, a few source files and no microservices. If you want to understand the full NanoClaw codebase, just ask Claude Code to walk you through it.

**Secure by isolation.** Agents run in Linux containers (Apple Container on macOS, or Docker) and they can only see what's explicitly mounted. Bash access is safe because commands run inside the container, not on your host.

**Built for the individual user.** NanoClaw isn't a monolithic framework; it's software that fits each user's exact needs. Instead of becoming bloatware, NanoClaw is designed to be bespoke. You make your own fork and have Claude Code modify it to match your needs.

**Customization = code changes.** No configuration sprawl. Want different behavior? Modify the code. The codebase is small enough that it's safe to make changes.

**AI-native.**
- No installation wizard; Claude Code guides setup.
- No monitoring dashboard; ask Claude what's happening.
- No debugging tools; describe the problem and Claude fixes it.

**Skills over features.** Instead of adding features (e.g. support for Telegram) to the codebase, contributors submit [claude code skills](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/skills) like `/add-telegram` that transform your fork. You end up with clean code that does exactly what you need.

**Best harness, best model.** NanoClaw runs on the Claude Agent SDK, which means you're running Claude Code directly. Claude Code is highly capable and its coding and problem-solving capabilities allow it to modify and expand NanoClaw and tailor it to each user.

## What It Supports

- **Multi-channel messaging** - Talk to your assistant from WhatsApp, Telegram, Discord, Slack, or Gmail. Add channels with skills like `/add-whatsapp` or `/add-telegram`. Run one or many at the same time.
- **Isolated group context** - Each group has its own `CLAUDE.md` memory, isolated filesystem, and runs in its own container sandbox with only that filesystem mounted to it.
- **Main channel** - Your private channel (self-chat) for admin control; every group is completely isolated
- **Scheduled tasks** - Recurring jobs that run Claude and can message you back
- **Web access** - Search and fetch content from the Web
- **Container isolation** - Agents are sandboxed in Docker (macOS/Linux), [Docker Sandboxes](docs/docker-sandboxes.md) (micro VM isolation), or Apple Container (macOS)
- **Credential security** - Agents never hold raw API keys. Outbound requests route through [OneCLI's Agent Vault](https://github.com/onecli/onecli), which injects credentials at request time and enforces per-agent policies and rate limits.
- **Agent Swarms** - Spin up teams of specialized agents that collaborate on complex tasks
- **Optional integrations** - Add Gmail (`/add-gmail`) and more via skills

## Usage

Talk to your assistant with the trigger word (default: `@Andy`):

```
@Andy send an overview of the sales pipeline every weekday morning at 9am (has access to my Obsidian vault folder)
@Andy review the git history for the past week each Friday and update the README if there's drift
@Andy every Monday at 8am, compile news on AI developments from Hacker News and TechCrunch and message me a briefing
```

From the main channel (your self-chat), you can manage groups and tasks:
```
@Andy list all scheduled tasks across groups
@Andy pause the Monday briefing task
@Andy join the Family Chat group
```

## Customizing

NanoClaw doesn't use configuration files. To make changes, just tell Claude Code what you want:

- "Change the trigger word to @Bob"
- "Remember in the future to make responses shorter and more direct"
- "Add a custom greeting when I say good morning"
- "Store conversation summaries weekly"

Or run `/customize` for guided changes.

The codebase is small enough that Claude can safely modify it.

## Contributing

**Don't add features. Add skills.**

If you want to add Telegram support, don't create a PR that adds Telegram to the core codebase. Instead, fork NanoClaw, make the code changes on a branch, and open a PR. We'll create a `skill/telegram` branch from your PR that other users can merge into their fork.

Users then run `/add-telegram` on their fork and get clean code that does exactly what they need, not a bloated system trying to support every use case.

### RFS (Request for Skills)

Skills we'd like to see:

**Communication Channels**
- `/add-signal` - Add Signal as a channel

## Requirements

- macOS, Linux, or Windows (via WSL2)
- Node.js 20+
- [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/download)
- [Apple Container](https://github.com/apple/container) (macOS) or [Docker](https://docker.com/products/docker-desktop) (macOS/Linux)

## Architecture

```
Channels --> SQLite --> Polling loop --> Container (Claude Agent SDK) --> Response
```

Single Node.js process. Channels are added via skills and self-register at startup — the orchestrator connects whichever ones have credentials present. Agents execute in isolated Linux containers with filesystem isolation. Only mounted directories are accessible. Per-group message queue with concurrency control. IPC via filesystem.

For the full architecture details, see the [documentation site](https://docs.nanoclaw.dev/concepts/architecture).

Key files:
- `src/index.ts` - Orchestrator: state, message loop, agent invocation
- `src/channels/registry.ts` - Channel registry (self-registration at startup)
- `src/ipc.ts` - IPC watcher and task processing
- `src/router.ts` - Message formatting and outbound routing
- `src/group-queue.ts` - Per-group queue with global concurrency limit
- `src/container-runner.ts` - Spawns streaming agent containers
- `src/task-scheduler.ts` - Runs scheduled tasks
- `src/db.ts` - SQLite operations (messages, groups, sessions, state)
- `groups/*/CLAUDE.md` - Per-group memory

## FAQ

**Why Docker?**

Docker provides cross-platform support (macOS, Linux and even Windows via WSL2) and a mature ecosystem. On macOS, you can optionally switch to Apple Container via `/convert-to-apple-container` for a lighter-weight native runtime. For additional isolation, [Docker Sandboxes](docs/docker-sandboxes.md) run each container inside a micro VM.

**Can I run this on Linux or Windows?**

Yes. Docker is the default runtime and works on macOS, Linux, and Windows (via WSL2). Just run `/setup`.

**Is this secure?**

Agents run in containers, not behind application-level permission checks. They can only access explicitly mounted directories. Credentials never enter the container — outbound API requests route through [OneCLI's Agent Vault](https://github.com/onecli/onecli), which injects authentication at the proxy level and supports rate limits and access policies. You should still review what you're running, but the codebase is small enough that you actually can. See the [security documentation](https://docs.nanoclaw.dev/concepts/security) for the full security model.

**Why no configuration files?**

We don't want configuration sprawl. Every user should customize NanoClaw so that the code does exactly what they want, rather than configuring a generic system. If you prefer having config files, you can tell Claude to add them.

**Can I use third-party or open-source models?**

Yes. NanoClaw supports any Claude API-compatible model endpoint. Set these environment variables in your `.env` file:

```bash
ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL=https://your-api-endpoint.com
ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN=your-token-here
```

This allows you to use:
- Local models via [Ollama](https://ollama.ai) with an API proxy
- Open-source models hosted on [Together AI](https://together.ai), [Fireworks](https://fireworks.ai), etc.
- Custom model deployments with Anthropic-compatible APIs

Note: The model must support the Anthropic API format for best compatibility.

**How do I debug issues?**

Ask Claude Code. "Why isn't the scheduler running?" "What's in the recent logs?" "Why did this message not get a response?" That's the AI-native approach that underlies NanoClaw.

**Why isn't the setup working for me?**

If you have issues, during setup, Claude will try to dynamically fix them. If that doesn't work, run `claude`, then run `/debug`. If Claude finds an issue that is likely affecting other users, open a PR to modify the setup SKILL.md.

**What changes will be accepted into the codebase?**

Only security fixes, bug fixes, and clear improvements will be accepted to the base configuration. That's all.

Everything else (new capabilities, OS compatibility, hardware support, enhancements) should be contributed as skills.

This keeps the base system minimal and lets every user customize their installation without inheriting features they don't want.

## NanoClawを作った理由

[OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw)は素晴らしいプロジェクトですが、理解しきれない複雑なソフトウェアに自分の生活へのフルアクセスを与えたまま安心して眠れるとは思えませんでした。OpenClawは約50万行のコード、53の設定ファイル、70以上の依存関係を持っています。セキュリティはアプリケーションレベル（許可リスト、ペアリングコード）であり、真のOS レベルの分離ではありません。すべてが共有メモリを持つ1つのNodeプロセスで動作します。

NanoClawは同じコア機能を提供しますが、理解できる規模のコードベースで実現しています：1つのプロセスと少数のファイル。Claudeエージェントは単なるパーミッションチェックの背後ではなく、ファイルシステム分離された独自のLinuxコンテナで実行されます。

## クイックスタート

```bash
gh repo fork qwibitai/nanoclaw --clone
cd nanoclaw
claude
```

<details>
<summary>GitHub CLIなしの場合</summary>

1. GitHub上で[qwibitai/nanoclaw](https://github.com/qwibitai/nanoclaw)をフォーク（Forkボタンをクリック）
2. `git clone https://github.com/<あなたのユーザー名>/nanoclaw.git`
3. `cd nanoclaw`
4. `claude`

</details>

その後、`/setup`を実行します。Claude Codeがすべてを処理します：依存関係、認証、コンテナセットアップ、サービス設定。

> **注意:** `/`で始まるコマンド（`/setup`、`/add-whatsapp`など）は[Claude Codeスキル](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/skills)です。通常のターミナルではなく、`claude` CLIプロンプト内で入力してください。Claude Codeをインストールしていない場合は、[claude.com/product/claude-code](https://claude.com/product/claude-code)から入手してください。

## 設計思想

**理解できる規模。** 1つのプロセス、少数のソースファイル、マイクロサービスなし。NanoClawのコードベース全体を理解したい場合は、Claude Codeに説明を求めるだけです。

**分離によるセキュリティ。** エージェントはLinuxコンテナ（macOSではApple Container、またはDocker）で実行され、明示的にマウントされたものだけが見えます。コマンドはホストではなくコンテナ内で実行されるため、Bashアクセスは安全です。

**個人ユーザー向け。** NanoClawはモノリシックなフレームワークではなく、各ユーザーのニーズに正確にフィットするソフトウェアです。肥大化するのではなく、オーダーメイドになるよう設計されています。自分のフォークを作成し、Claude Codeにニーズに合わせて変更させます。

**カスタマイズ＝コード変更。** 設定ファイルの肥大化なし。動作を変えたい？コードを変更するだけ。コードベースは変更しても安全な規模です。

**AIネイティブ。**
- インストールウィザードなし — Claude Codeがセットアップを案内。
- モニタリングダッシュボードなし — Claudeに状況を聞くだけ。
- デバッグツールなし — 問題を説明すればClaudeが修正。

**機能追加ではなくスキル。** コードベースに機能（例：Telegram対応）を追加する代わりに、コントリビューターは`/add-telegram`のような[Claude Codeスキル](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/skills)を提出し、あなたのフォークを変換します。あなたが必要なものだけを正確に実行するクリーンなコードが手に入ります。

**最高のハーネス、最高のモデル。** NanoClawはClaude Agent SDK上で動作します。つまり、Claude Codeを直接実行しているということです。Claude Codeは高い能力を持ち、そのコーディングと問題解決能力によってNanoClawを変更・拡張し、各ユーザーに合わせてカスタマイズできます。

## サポート機能

- **マルチチャネルメッセージング** - WhatsApp、Telegram、Discord、Slack、Gmailからアシスタントと会話。`/add-whatsapp`や`/add-telegram`などのスキルでチャネルを追加。1つでも複数でも同時に実行可能。
- **グループごとの分離コンテキスト** - 各グループは独自の`CLAUDE.md`メモリ、分離されたファイルシステムを持ち、そのファイルシステムのみがマウントされた専用コンテナサンドボックスで実行。
- **メインチャネル** - 管理制御用のプライベートチャネル（セルフチャット）。各グループは完全に分離。
- **スケジュールタスク** - Claudeを実行し、メッセージを返せる定期ジョブ。
- **Webアクセス** - Webからのコンテンツ検索・取得。
- **コンテナ分離** - エージェントは[Dockerサンドボックス](https://nanoclaw.dev/blog/nanoclaw-docker-sandboxes)（マイクロVM分離）、Apple Container（macOS）、またはDocker（macOS/Linux）でサンドボックス化。
- **エージェントスウォーム** - 複雑なタスクで協力する専門エージェントチームを起動。
- **オプション連携** - Gmail（`/add-gmail`）などをスキルで追加。

## 使い方

トリガーワード（デフォルト：`@Andy`）でアシスタントに話しかけます：

```
@Andy 毎朝9時に営業パイプラインの概要を送って（Obsidian vaultフォルダにアクセス可能）
@Andy 毎週金曜に過去1週間のgit履歴をレビューして、差異があればREADMEを更新して
@Andy 毎週月曜の朝8時に、Hacker NewsとTechCrunchからAI関連のニュースをまとめてブリーフィングを送って
```

メインチャネル（セルフチャット）から、グループやタスクを管理できます：
```
@Andy 全グループのスケジュールタスクを一覧表示して
@Andy 月曜のブリーフィングタスクを一時停止して
@Andy Family Chatグループに参加して
```

## カスタマイズ

NanoClawは設定ファイルを使いません。変更するには、Claude Codeに伝えるだけです：

- 「トリガーワードを@Bobに変更して」
- 「今後はレスポンスをもっと短く直接的にして」
- 「おはようと言ったらカスタム挨拶を追加して」
- 「会話の要約を毎週保存して」

または`/customize`を実行してガイド付きの変更を行えます。

コードベースは十分に小さいため、Claudeが安全に変更できます。

## コントリビューション

**機能を追加するのではなく、スキルを追加してください。**

Telegram対応を追加したい場合、コアコードベースにTelegramを追加するPRを作成しないでください。代わりに、NanoClawをフォークし、ブランチでコード変更を行い、PRを開いてください。あなたのPRから`skill/telegram`ブランチを作成し、他のユーザーが自分のフォークにマージできるようにします。

ユーザーは自分のフォークで`/add-telegram`を実行するだけで、あらゆるユースケースに対応しようとする肥大化したシステムではなく、必要なものだけを正確に実行するクリーンなコードが手に入ります。

### RFS（スキル募集）

私たちが求めているスキル：

**コミュニケーションチャネル**
- `/add-signal` - Signalをチャネルとして追加

**セッション管理**
- `/clear` - 会話をコンパクト化する`/clear`コマンドの追加（同一セッション内で重要な情報を保持しながらコンテキストを要約）。Claude Agent SDKを通じてプログラム的にコンパクト化をトリガーする方法の解明が必要。

## 必要条件

- macOSまたはLinux
- Node.js 20以上
- [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/download)
- [Apple Container](https://github.com/apple/container)（macOS）または[Docker](https://docker.com/products/docker-desktop)（macOS/Linux）

## アーキテクチャ

```
チャネル --> SQLite --> ポーリングループ --> コンテナ（Claude Agent SDK） --> レスポンス
```

単一のNode.jsプロセス。チャネルはスキルで追加され、起動時に自己登録します — オーケストレーターは認証情報が存在するチャネルを接続します。エージェントはファイルシステム分離された独立したLinuxコンテナで実行されます。マウントされたディレクトリのみアクセス可能。グループごとのメッセージキューと同時実行制御。ファイルシステム経由のIPC。

詳細なアーキテクチャについては、[docs/SPEC.md](spec.md)を参照してください。

主要ファイル：
- `src/index.ts` - オーケストレーター：状態、メッセージループ、エージェント呼び出し
- `src/channels/registry.ts` - チャネルレジストリ（起動時の自己登録）
- `src/ipc.ts` - IPCウォッチャーとタスク処理
- `src/router.ts` - メッセージフォーマットとアウトバウンドルーティング
- `src/group-queue.ts` - グローバル同時実行制限付きのグループごとのキュー
- `src/container-runner.ts` - ストリーミングエージェントコンテナの起動
- `src/task-scheduler.ts` - スケジュールタスクの実行
- `src/db.ts` - SQLite操作（メッセージ、グループ、セッション、状態）
- `groups/*/CLAUDE.md` - グループごとのメモリ

## FAQ

**なぜDockerなのか？**

Dockerはクロスプラットフォーム対応（macOS、Linux、さらにWSL2経由のWindows）と成熟したエコシステムを提供します。macOSでは、`/convert-to-apple-container`でオプションとしてApple Containerに切り替え、より軽量なネイティブランタイムを使用できます。

**Linuxで実行できますか？**

はい。DockerがデフォルトのランタイムでmacOSとLinuxの両方で動作します。`/setup`を実行するだけです。

**セキュリティは大丈夫ですか？**

エージェントはアプリケーションレベルのパーミッションチェックの背後ではなく、コンテナで実行されます。明示的にマウントされたディレクトリのみアクセスできます。実行するものをレビューすべきですが、コードベースは十分に小さいため実際にレビュー可能です。完全なセキュリティモデルについては[docs/SECURITY.md](../bmad_repo/SECURITY.md)を参照してください。

**なぜ設定ファイルがないのか？**

設定の肥大化を避けたいからです。すべてのユーザーがNanoClawをカスタマイズし、汎用的なシステムを設定するのではなく、コードが必要なことを正確に実行するようにすべきです。設定ファイルが欲しい場合は、Claudeに追加するよう伝えることができます。

**サードパーティやオープンソースモデルを使えますか？**

はい。NanoClawはClaude API互換のモデルエンドポイントに対応しています。`.env`ファイルで以下の環境変数を設定してください：

```bash
ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL=https://your-api-endpoint.com
ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN=your-token-here
```

以下が使用可能です：
- [Ollama](https://ollama.ai)とAPIプロキシ経由のローカルモデル
- [Together AI](https://together.ai)、[Fireworks](https://fireworks.ai)等でホストされたオープンソースモデル
- Anthropic互換APIのカスタムモデルデプロイメント

注意：最高の互換性のため、モデルはAnthropic APIフォーマットに対応している必要があります。

**問題のデバッグ方法は？**

Claude Codeに聞いてください。「スケジューラーが動いていないのはなぜ？」「最近のログには何がある？」「このメッセージに返信がなかったのはなぜ？」これがNanoClawの基盤となるAIネイティブなアプローチです。

**セットアップがうまくいかない場合は？**

問題がある場合、セットアップ中にClaudeが動的に修正を試みます。それでもうまくいかない場合は、`claude`を実行してから`/debug`を実行してください。Claudeが他のユーザーにも影響する可能性のある問題を見つけた場合は、セットアップのSKILL.mdを修正するPRを開いてください。

**どのような変更がコードベースに受け入れられますか？**

セキュリティ修正、バグ修正、明確な改善のみが基本設定に受け入れられます。それだけです。

それ以外のすべて（新機能、OS互換性、ハードウェアサポート、機能拡張）はスキルとしてコントリビューションすべきです。

これにより、基本システムを最小限に保ち、すべてのユーザーが不要な機能を継承することなく、自分のインストールをカスタマイズできます。

通过 Claude Code，NanoClaw 可以动态重写自身代码，根据您的需求定制功能。

**新功能：** 首个支持 [Agent Swarms（智能体集群）](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/agent-teams) 的 AI 助手。可轻松组建智能体团队，在您的聊天中高效协作。

## 我为什么创建这个项目

[OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw) 是一个令人印象深刻的项目，但我无法安心使用一个我不了解却能访问我个人隐私的软件。OpenClaw 有近 50 万行代码、53 个配置文件和 70+ 个依赖项。其安全性是应用级别的（通过白名单、配对码实现），而非操作系统级别的隔离。所有东西都在一个共享内存的 Node 进程中运行。

NanoClaw 用一个您能快速理解的代码库，为您提供了同样的核心功能。只有一个进程，少数几个文件。智能体（Agent）运行在具有文件系统隔离的真实 Linux 容器中，而不是依赖于权限检查。

## 快速开始

```bash
git clone https://github.com/qwibitai/nanoclaw.git
cd nanoclaw
claude
```

然后运行 `/setup`。Claude Code 会处理一切：依赖安装、身份验证、容器设置、服务配置。

> **注意：** 以 `/` 开头的命令（如 `/setup`、`/add-whatsapp`）是 [Claude Code 技能](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/skills)。请在 `claude` CLI 提示符中输入，而非在普通终端中。

## 设计哲学

**小巧易懂：** 单一进程，少量源文件。无微服务、无消息队列、无复杂抽象层。让 Claude Code 引导您轻松上手。

**通过隔离保障安全:** 智能体运行在 Linux 容器（在 macOS 上是 Apple Container，或 Docker）中。它们只能看到被明确挂载的内容。即便通过 Bash 访问也十分安全，因为所有命令都在容器内执行，不会直接操作您的宿主机。

**为单一用户打造:** 这不是一个框架，是一个完全符合您个人需求的、可工作的软件。您可以 Fork 本项目，然后让 Claude Code 根据您的精确需求进行修改和适配。

**定制即代码修改:** 没有繁杂的配置文件。想要不同的行为？直接修改代码。代码库足够小，这样做是安全的。

**AI 原生:** 无安装向导（由 Claude Code 指导安装）。无需监控仪表盘，直接询问 Claude 即可了解系统状况。无调试工具（描述问题，Claude 会修复它）。

**技能（Skills）优于功能（Features）:** 贡献者不应该向代码库添加新功能（例如支持 Telegram）。相反，他们应该贡献像 `/add-telegram` 这样的 [Claude Code 技能](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/skills)，这些技能可以改造您的 fork。最终，您得到的是只做您需要事情的整洁代码。

**最好的工具套件，最好的模型:** 本项目运行在 Claude Agent SDK 之上，这意味着您直接运行的就是 Claude Code。Claude Code 高度强大，其编码和问题解决能力使其能够修改和扩展 NanoClaw，为每个用户量身定制。

## 功能支持

- **多渠道消息** - 通过 WhatsApp、Telegram、Discord、Slack 或 Gmail 与您的助手对话。使用 `/add-whatsapp` 或 `/add-telegram` 等技能添加渠道，可同时运行一个或多个。
- **隔离的群组上下文** - 每个群组都拥有独立的 `CLAUDE.md` 记忆和隔离的文件系统。它们在各自的容器沙箱中运行，且仅挂载所需的文件系统。
- **主频道** - 您的私有频道（self-chat），用于管理控制；其他所有群组都完全隔离
- **计划任务** - 运行 Claude 的周期性作业，并可以给您回发消息
- **网络访问** - 搜索和抓取网页内容
- **容器隔离** - 智能体在 Apple Container (macOS) 或 Docker (macOS/Linux) 的沙箱中运行
- **智能体集群（Agent Swarms）** - 启动多个专业智能体团队，协作完成复杂任务（首个支持此功能的个人 AI 助手）
- **可选集成** - 通过技能添加 Gmail (`/add-gmail`) 等更多功能

## 使用方法

使用触发词（默认为 `@Andy`）与您的助手对话：

```
@Andy 每周一到周五早上9点，给我发一份销售渠道的概览（需要访问我的 Obsidian vault 文件夹）
@Andy 每周五回顾过去一周的 git 历史，如果与 README 有出入，就更新它
@Andy 每周一早上8点，从 Hacker News 和 TechCrunch 收集关于 AI 发展的资讯，然后发给我一份简报
```

在主频道（您的self-chat）中，可以管理群组和任务：
```
@Andy 列出所有群组的计划任务
@Andy 暂停周一简报任务
@Andy 加入"家庭聊天"群组
```

## 定制

没有需要学习的配置文件。直接告诉 Claude Code 您想要什么：

- "把触发词改成 @Bob"
- "记住以后回答要更简短直接"
- "当我说早上好的时候，加一个自定义的问候"
- "每周存储一次对话摘要"

或者运行 `/customize` 进行引导式修改。

代码库足够小，Claude 可以安全地修改它。

## 贡献

**不要添加功能，而是添加技能。**

如果您想添加 Telegram 支持，不要创建一个 PR 同时添加 Telegram 和 WhatsApp。而是贡献一个技能文件 (`.claude/skills/add-telegram/SKILL.md`)，教 Claude Code 如何改造一个 NanoClaw 安装以使用 Telegram。

然后用户在自己的 fork 上运行 `/add-telegram`，就能得到只做他们需要事情的整洁代码，而不是一个试图支持所有用例的臃肿系统。

### RFS (技能征集)

我们希望看到的技能：

**通信渠道**
- `/add-signal` - 添加 Signal 作为渠道

**会话管理**
- `/clear` - 添加一个 `/clear` 命令，用于压缩会话（在同一会话中总结上下文，同时保留关键信息）。这需要研究如何通过 Claude Agent SDK 以编程方式触发压缩。

## 系统要求

- macOS 或 Linux
- Node.js 20+
- [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/download)
- [Apple Container](https://github.com/apple/container) (macOS) 或 [Docker](https://docker.com/products/docker-desktop) (macOS/Linux)

## 架构

```
渠道 --> SQLite --> 轮询循环 --> 容器 (Claude Agent SDK) --> 响应
```

单一 Node.js 进程。渠道通过技能添加，启动时自注册 — 编排器连接具有凭据的渠道。智能体在具有文件系统隔离的 Linux 容器中执行。每个群组的消息队列带有并发控制。通过文件系统进行 IPC。

完整架构详情请见 [docs/SPEC.md](spec.md)。

关键文件：
- `src/index.ts` - 编排器：状态管理、消息循环、智能体调用
- `src/channels/registry.ts` - 渠道注册表（启动时自注册）
- `src/ipc.ts` - IPC 监听与任务处理
- `src/router.ts` - 消息格式化与出站路由
- `src/group-queue.ts` - 带全局并发限制的群组队列
- `src/container-runner.ts` - 生成流式智能体容器
- `src/task-scheduler.ts` - 运行计划任务
- `src/db.ts` - SQLite 操作（消息、群组、会话、状态）
- `groups/*/CLAUDE.md` - 各群组的记忆

## FAQ

**为什么是 Docker？**

Docker 提供跨平台支持（macOS 和 Linux）和成熟的生态系统。在 macOS 上，您可以选择通过运行 `/convert-to-apple-container` 切换到 Apple Container，以获得更轻量级的原生运行时体验。

**我可以在 Linux 上运行吗？**

可以。Docker 是默认的容器运行时，在 macOS 和 Linux 上都可以使用。只需运行 `/setup`。

**这个项目安全吗？**

智能体在容器中运行，而不是在应用级别的权限检查之后。它们只能访问被明确挂载的目录。您仍然应该审查您运行的代码，但这个代码库小到您真的可以做到。完整的安全模型请见 [docs/SECURITY.md](../bmad_repo/SECURITY.md)。

**为什么没有配置文件？**

我们不希望配置泛滥。每个用户都应该定制它，让代码完全符合他们的需求，而不是去配置一个通用的系统。如果您喜欢用配置文件，告诉 Claude 让它加上。

**我可以使用第三方或开源模型吗？**

可以。NanoClaw 支持任何 API 兼容的模型端点。在 `.env` 文件中设置以下环境变量：

```bash
ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL=https://your-api-endpoint.com
ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN=your-token-here
```

这使您能够使用：
- 通过 [Ollama](https://ollama.ai) 配合 API 代理运行的本地模型
- 托管在 [Together AI](https://together.ai)、[Fireworks](https://fireworks.ai) 等平台上的开源模型
- 兼容 Anthropic API 格式的自定义模型部署

注意：为获得最佳兼容性，模型需支持 Anthropic API 格式。

**我该如何调试问题？**

问 Claude Code。"为什么计划任务没有运行？" "最近的日志里有什么？" "为什么这条消息没有得到回应？" 这就是 AI 原生的方法。

**为什么我的安装不成功？**

如果遇到问题，安装过程中 Claude 会尝试动态修复。如果问题仍然存在，运行 `claude`，然后运行 `/debug`。如果 Claude 发现一个可能影响其他用户的问题，请开一个 PR 来修改 setup SKILL.md。

**什么样的代码更改会被接受？**

安全修复、bug 修复，以及对基础配置的明确改进。仅此而已。

其他一切（新功能、操作系统兼容性、硬件支持、增强功能）都应该作为技能来贡献。

这使得基础系统保持最小化，并让每个用户可以定制他们的安装，而无需继承他们不想要的功能。

  `Schedule a recurring or one-time task. The task will run as a full agent with access to all tools. Returns the task ID for future reference. To modify an existing task, use update_task instead.

CONTEXT MODE - Choose based on task type:
\u2022 "group": Task runs in the group's conversation context, with access to chat history. Use for tasks that need context about ongoing discussions, user preferences, or recent interactions.
\u2022 "isolated": Task runs in a fresh session with no conversation history. Use for independent tasks that don't need prior context. When using isolated mode, include all necessary context in the prompt itself.

If unsure which mode to use, you can ask the user. Examples:
- "Remind me about our discussion" \u2192 group (needs conversation context)
- "Check the weather every morning" \u2192 isolated (self-contained task)
- "Follow up on my request" \u2192 group (needs to know what was requested)
- "Generate a daily report" \u2192 isolated (just needs instructions in prompt)

MESSAGING BEHAVIOR - The task agent's output is sent to the user or group. It can also use send_message for immediate delivery, or wrap output in <internal> tags to suppress it. Include guidance in the prompt about whether the agent should:
\u2022 Always send a message (e.g., reminders, daily briefings)
\u2022 Only send a message when there's something to report (e.g., "notify me if...")
\u2022 Never send a message (background maintenance tasks)

SCHEDULE VALUE FORMAT (all times are LOCAL timezone):
\u2022 cron: Standard cron expression (e.g., "*/5 * * * *" for every 5 minutes, "0 9 * * *" for daily at 9am LOCAL time)
\u2022 interval: Milliseconds between runs (e.g., "300000" for 5 minutes, "3600000" for 1 hour)

name: agent-browser
description: Browse the web for any task — research topics, read articles, interact with web apps, fill forms, take screenshots, extract data, and test web pages. Use whenever a browser would be useful, not just when the user explicitly asks.
allowed-tools: Bash(agent-browser:*)
---

# Browser Automation with agent-browser

## Quick start

```bash
agent-browser open <url>        # Navigate to page
agent-browser snapshot -i       # Get interactive elements with refs
agent-browser click @e1         # Click element by ref
agent-browser fill @e2 "text"   # Fill input by ref
agent-browser close             # Close browser
```

## Core workflow

1. Navigate: `agent-browser open <url>`
2. Snapshot: `agent-browser snapshot -i` (returns elements with refs like `@e1`, `@e2`)
3. Interact using refs from the snapshot
4. Re-snapshot after navigation or significant DOM changes

## Commands

### Navigation

```bash
agent-browser open <url>      # Navigate to URL
agent-browser back            # Go back
agent-browser forward         # Go forward
agent-browser reload          # Reload page
agent-browser close           # Close browser
```

### Snapshot (page analysis)

```bash
agent-browser snapshot            # Full accessibility tree
agent-browser snapshot -i         # Interactive elements only (recommended)
agent-browser snapshot -c         # Compact output
agent-browser snapshot -d 3       # Limit depth to 3
agent-browser snapshot -s "#main" # Scope to CSS selector
```

### Interactions (use @refs from snapshot)

```bash
agent-browser click @e1           # Click
agent-browser dblclick @e1        # Double-click
agent-browser fill @e2 "text"     # Clear and type
agent-browser type @e2 "text"     # Type without clearing
agent-browser press Enter         # Press key
agent-browser hover @e1           # Hover
agent-browser check @e1           # Check checkbox
agent-browser uncheck @e1         # Uncheck checkbox
agent-browser select @e1 "value"  # Select dropdown option
agent-browser scroll down 500     # Scroll page
agent-browser upload @e1 file.pdf # Upload files
```

### Get information

```bash
agent-browser get text @e1        # Get element text
agent-browser get html @e1        # Get innerHTML
agent-browser get value @e1       # Get input value
agent-browser get attr @e1 href   # Get attribute
agent-browser get title           # Get page title
agent-browser get url             # Get current URL
agent-browser get count ".item"   # Count matching elements
```

### Screenshots & PDF

```bash
agent-browser screenshot          # Save to temp directory
agent-browser screenshot path.png # Save to specific path
agent-browser screenshot --full   # Full page
agent-browser pdf output.pdf      # Save as PDF
```

### Wait

```bash
agent-browser wait @e1                     # Wait for element
agent-browser wait 2000                    # Wait milliseconds
agent-browser wait --text "Success"        # Wait for text
agent-browser wait --url "**/dashboard"    # Wait for URL pattern
agent-browser wait --load networkidle      # Wait for network idle
```

### Semantic locators (alternative to refs)

```bash
agent-browser find role button click --name "Submit"
agent-browser find text "Sign In" click
agent-browser find label "Email" fill "user@test.com"
agent-browser find placeholder "Search" type "query"
```

### Authentication with saved state

```bash
# Login once
agent-browser open https://app.example.com/login
agent-browser snapshot -i
agent-browser fill @e1 "username"
agent-browser fill @e2 "password"
agent-browser click @e3

name: capabilities
description: Show what this NanoClaw instance can do — installed skills, available tools, and system info. Read-only. Use when the user asks what the bot can do, what's installed, or runs /capabilities.
---

# /capabilities — System Capabilities Report

Generate a structured read-only report of what this NanoClaw instance can do.

**Main-channel check:** Only the main channel has `/workspace/project` mounted. Run:

```bash
test -d /workspace/project && echo "MAIN" || echo "NOT_MAIN"
```

If `NOT_MAIN`, respond with:
> This command is available in your main chat only. Send `/capabilities` there to see what I can do.

Then stop — do not generate the report.

## How to gather the information

Run these commands and compile the results into the report format below.

### 1. Installed skills

List skill directories available to you:

```bash
ls -1 /home/node/.claude/skills/ 2>/dev/null || echo "No skills found"
```

Each directory is an installed skill. The directory name is the skill name (e.g., `agent-browser` → `/agent-browser`).

### 2. Available tools

Read the allowed tools from your SDK configuration. You always have access to:
- **Core:** Bash, Read, Write, Edit, Glob, Grep
- **Web:** WebSearch, WebFetch
- **Orchestration:** Task, TaskOutput, TaskStop, TeamCreate, TeamDelete, SendMessage
- **Other:** TodoWrite, ToolSearch, Skill, NotebookEdit
- **MCP:** mcp__nanoclaw__* (messaging, tasks, group management)

### 3. MCP server tools

The NanoClaw MCP server exposes these tools (via `mcp__nanoclaw__*` prefix):
- `send_message` — send a message to the user/group
- `schedule_task` — schedule a recurring or one-time task
- `list_tasks` — list scheduled tasks
- `pause_task` — pause a scheduled task
- `resume_task` — resume a paused task
- `cancel_task` — cancel and delete a task
- `update_task` — update an existing task
- `register_group` — register a new chat/group (main only)

### 4. Container skills (Bash tools)

Check for executable tools in the container:

```bash
which agent-browser 2>/dev/null && echo "agent-browser: available" || echo "agent-browser: not found"
```

### 5. Group info

```bash
ls /workspace/group/CLAUDE.md 2>/dev/null && echo "Group memory: yes" || echo "Group memory: no"
ls /workspace/extra/ 2>/dev/null && echo "Extra mounts: $(ls /workspace/extra/ 2>/dev/null | wc -l | tr -d ' ')" || echo "Extra mounts: none"
```

## Report format

Present the report as a clean, readable message. Example:

```
📋 *NanoClaw Capabilities*

*Installed Skills:*
• /agent-browser — Browse the web, fill forms, extract data
• /capabilities — This report
(list all found skills)

*Tools:*
• Core: Bash, Read, Write, Edit, Glob, Grep
• Web: WebSearch, WebFetch
• Orchestration: Task, TeamCreate, SendMessage
• MCP: send_message, schedule_task, list_tasks, pause/resume/cancel/update_task, register_group

*Container Tools:*
• agent-browser: ✓

*System:*
• Group memory: yes/no
• Extra mounts: N directories
• Main channel: yes
```

Adapt the output based on what you actually find — don't list things that aren't installed.

**See also:** `/status` for a quick health check of session, workspace, and tasks.

name: slack-formatting
description: Format messages for Slack using mrkdwn syntax. Use when responding to Slack channels (folder starts with "slack_" or JID contains slack identifiers).
---

# Slack Message Formatting (mrkdwn)

When responding to Slack channels, use Slack's mrkdwn syntax instead of standard Markdown.

## How to detect Slack context

Check your group folder name or workspace path:
- Folder starts with `slack_` (e.g., `slack_engineering`, `slack_general`)
- Or check `/workspace/group/` path for `slack_` prefix

## Formatting reference

### Text styles

| Style | Syntax | Example |
|-------|--------|---------|
| Bold | `*text*` | *bold text* |
| Italic | `_text_` | _italic text_ |
| Strikethrough | `~text~` | ~strikethrough~ |
| Code (inline) | `` `code` `` | `inline code` |
| Code block | ` ```code``` ` | Multi-line code |

### Links and mentions

```
<https://example.com|Link text>     # Named link
<https://example.com>                # Auto-linked URL
<@U1234567890>                       # Mention user by ID
<#C1234567890>                       # Mention channel by ID
<!here>                              # @here
<!channel>                           # @channel
```

### Lists

Slack supports simple bullet lists but NOT numbered lists:

```
• First item
• Second item
• Third item
```

Use `•` (bullet character) or `- ` or `* ` for bullets.

### Block quotes

```
> This is a block quote
> It can span multiple lines
```

### Emoji

Use standard emoji shortcodes: `:white_check_mark:`, `:x:`, `:rocket:`, `:tada:`

## What NOT to use

- **NO** `##` headings (use `*Bold text*` for headers instead)
- **NO** `**double asterisks**` for bold (use `*single asterisks*`)
- **NO** `[text](url)` links (use `<url|text>` instead)
- **NO** `1.` numbered lists (use bullets with numbers: `• 1. First`)
- **NO** tables (use code blocks or plain text alignment)
- **NO** `---` horizontal rules

## Example message

```
*Daily Standup Summary*

_March 21, 2026_

• *Completed:* Fixed authentication bug in login flow
• *In Progress:* Building new dashboard widgets
• *Blocked:* Waiting on API access from DevOps

> Next sync: Monday 10am

:white_check_mark: All tests passing | <https://ci.example.com/builds/123|View Build>
```

## Quick rules

1. Use `*bold*` not `**bold**`
2. Use `<url|text>` not `[text](url)`
3. Use `•` bullets, avoid numbered lists
4. Use `:emoji:` shortcodes
5. Quote blocks with `>`
6. Skip headings — use bold text instead
```

## File: `container/skills/status/SKILL.md`
```markdown

name: status
description: Quick read-only health check — session context, workspace mounts, tool availability, and task snapshot. Use when the user asks for system status or runs /status.
---

# /status — System Status Check

Generate a quick read-only status report of the current agent environment.

**Main-channel check:** Only the main channel has `/workspace/project` mounted. Run:

```bash
test -d /workspace/project && echo "MAIN" || echo "NOT_MAIN"
```

If `NOT_MAIN`, respond with:
> This command is available in your main chat only. Send `/status` there to check system status.

Then stop — do not generate the report.

## How to gather the information

Run the checks below and compile results into the report format.

### 1. Session context

```bash
echo "Timestamp: $(date)"
echo "Working dir: $(pwd)"
echo "Channel: main"
```

### 2. Workspace and mount visibility

```bash
echo "=== Workspace ==="
ls /workspace/ 2>/dev/null
echo "=== Group folder ==="
ls /workspace/group/ 2>/dev/null | head -20
echo "=== Extra mounts ==="
ls /workspace/extra/ 2>/dev/null || echo "none"
echo "=== IPC ==="
ls /workspace/ipc/ 2>/dev/null
```

### 3. Tool availability

Confirm which tool families are available to you:

- **Core:** Bash, Read, Write, Edit, Glob, Grep
- **Web:** WebSearch, WebFetch
- **Orchestration:** Task, TaskOutput, TaskStop, TeamCreate, TeamDelete, SendMessage
- **MCP:** mcp__nanoclaw__* (send_message, schedule_task, list_tasks, pause_task, resume_task, cancel_task, update_task, register_group)

### 4. Container utilities

```bash
which agent-browser 2>/dev/null && echo "agent-browser: available" || echo "agent-browser: not installed"
node --version 2>/dev/null
claude --version 2>/dev/null
```

### 5. Task snapshot

Use the MCP tool to list tasks:

```
Call mcp__nanoclaw__list_tasks to get scheduled tasks.
```

If no tasks exist, report "No scheduled tasks."

## Report format

Present as a clean, readable message:

```
🔍 *NanoClaw Status*

*Session:*
• Channel: main
• Time: 2026-03-14 09:30 UTC
• Working dir: /workspace/group

*Workspace:*
• Group folder: ✓ (N files)
• Extra mounts: none / N directories
• IPC: ✓ (messages, tasks, input)

*Tools:*
• Core: ✓  Web: ✓  Orchestration: ✓  MCP: ✓

*Container:*
• agent-browser: ✓ / not installed
• Node: vXX.X.X
• Claude Code: vX.X.X

*Scheduled Tasks:*
• N active tasks / No scheduled tasks
```

Adapt based on what you actually find. Keep it concise — this is a quick health check, not a deep diagnostic.

## File: `docs/APPLE-CONTAINER-NETWORKING.md`
```markdown
# Apple Container Networking Setup (macOS 26)

Apple Container's vmnet networking requires manual configuration for containers to access the internet. Without this, containers can communicate with the host but cannot reach external services (DNS, HTTPS, APIs).

## Quick Setup

Run these two commands (requires `sudo`):

```bash
# 1. Enable IP forwarding so the host routes container traffic
sudo sysctl -w net.inet.ip.forwarding=1

# 2. Enable NAT so container traffic gets masqueraded through your internet interface
echo "nat on en0 from 192.168.64.0/24 to any -> (en0)" | sudo pfctl -ef -
```

> **Note:** Replace `en0` with your active internet interface. Check with: `route get 8.8.8.8 | grep interface`

## Making It Persistent

These settings reset on reboot. To make them permanent:

**IP Forwarding** — add to `/etc/sysctl.conf`:
```
net.inet.ip.forwarding=1
```

**NAT Rules** — add to `/etc/pf.conf` (before any existing rules):
```
nat on en0 from 192.168.64.0/24 to any -> (en0)
```

Then reload: `sudo pfctl -f /etc/pf.conf`

## IPv6 DNS Issue

By default, DNS resolvers return IPv6 (AAAA) records before IPv4 (A) records. Since our NAT only handles IPv4, Node.js applications inside containers will try IPv6 first and fail.

The container image and runner are configured to prefer IPv4 via:
```
NODE_OPTIONS=--dns-result-order=ipv4first
```

This is set both in the `Dockerfile` and passed via `-e` flag in `container-runner.ts`.

## Verification

```bash
# Check IP forwarding is enabled
sysctl net.inet.ip.forwarding
# Expected: net.inet.ip.forwarding: 1

# Test container internet access
container run --rm --entrypoint curl nanoclaw-agent:latest \
  -s4 --connect-timeout 5 -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" https://api.anthropic.com
# Expected: 404

# Check bridge interface (only exists when a container is running)
ifconfig bridge100
```

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|---------|-------|-----|
| `curl: (28) Connection timed out` | IP forwarding disabled | `sudo sysctl -w net.inet.ip.forwarding=1` |
| HTTP works, HTTPS times out | IPv6 DNS resolution | Add `NODE_OPTIONS=--dns-result-order=ipv4first` |
| `Could not resolve host` | DNS not forwarded | Check bridge100 exists, verify pfctl NAT rules |
| Container hangs after output | Missing `process.exit(0)` in agent-runner | Rebuild container image |

## How It Works

```
Container VM (192.168.64.x)
    │
    ├── eth0 → gateway 192.168.64.1
    │
bridge100 (192.168.64.1) ← host bridge, created by vmnet when container runs
    │
    ├── IP forwarding (sysctl) routes packets from bridge100 → en0
    │
    ├── NAT (pfctl) masquerades 192.168.64.0/24 → en0's IP
    │
en0 (your WiFi/Ethernet) → Internet
```

## File: `docs/BRANCH-FORK-MAINTENANCE.md`
```markdown
# Branch & Fork Maintenance Guidelines

## Structure

**`qwibitai/nanoclaw`** (upstream) — core engine with skill definitions (`.claude/skills/`). No channel code on `main`.

**Channel forks** (`nanoclaw-whatsapp`, `nanoclaw-telegram`, `nanoclaw-slack`, etc.) — each fork = upstream + one channel's code applied. Users clone upstream, then merge a fork into their clone to add a channel.

**`skill/*` and `feat/*` branches on upstream** — add features unrelated to channels (e.g. `skill/compact`, `skill/apple-container`). Users merge these into their clone to add capabilities. Channel-specific skill branches that duplicate the forks (e.g. `skill/whatsapp`, `skill/telegram`) are legacy.

## How users add capabilities

```
user clones upstream main
  ├── merges nanoclaw-whatsapp fork  → adds WhatsApp
  ├── merges skill/compact branch    → adds /compact command
  └── merges skill/apple-container   → switches to Apple Container
```

## Merge directions

```
upstream main ──→ channel forks     (forward merge to keep forks caught up)
upstream main ──→ skill branches    (forward merge to keep branches caught up)
```

Forks and skill branches carry applied code changes. Users merge them into their own clones/forks to add capabilities. They are never merged back into upstream `main`.

## Forward merge procedure

```bash
# In your local nanoclaw checkout
git checkout main && git pull

# For a fork:
git fetch nanoclaw-whatsapp
git checkout -B whatsapp-merge nanoclaw-whatsapp/main
git merge main
# Resolve conflicts (see below)
# Remove upstream-only workflows (re-added by every merge since main has them):
git rm .github/workflows/bump-version.yml .github/workflows/update-tokens.yml 2>/dev/null
git push nanoclaw-whatsapp HEAD:main
git checkout main && git branch -D whatsapp-merge

# For a skill branch:
git checkout -B skill/compact origin/skill/compact
git merge main
# Resolve conflicts (see below)
git push origin skill/compact
git checkout main && git branch -D skill/compact
```

## Conflict resolution

The same files conflict every time:

| File | Resolution |
|------|------------|
| `package.json` | Take main's version + keep fork/branch-specific deps |
| `package-lock.json` | `git checkout main -- package-lock.json && npm install` |
| `.env.example` | Combine: main's entries + fork/branch-specific entries |
| `repo-tokens/badge.svg` | Take main's version (auto-generated) |

Source code changes (e.g. `src/types.ts`, `src/index.ts`) usually auto-merge cleanly, but can conflict if both sides modify the same lines. **Always build and test after every forward merge** — auto-merged code can be silently wrong (e.g. referencing a renamed function or using a removed parameter) even when git reports no conflicts.

## When to merge forward

After any main change that touches shared files (`package.json`, `src/index.ts`, `CLAUDE.md`, etc.). Small frequent merges = trivial conflicts. Large infrequent merges = painful.

## Fork setup

When creating a new channel fork:

1. Fork `nanoclaw` to `nanoclaw-{channel}`
2. Remove upstream-only workflows: `bump-version.yml`, `update-tokens.yml`
3. Add channel code, deps, env vars
4. Forward-merge main immediately to establish a clean baseline

## Dependencies

Forks and branches add their own deps on top of upstream's. When upstream adds or removes a dependency, verify that forks/branches still build after the next forward merge — transitive dependency changes can break downstream code.
```

## File: `docs/DEBUG_CHECKLIST.md`
```markdown
# NanoClaw Debug Checklist

## Known Issues (2026-02-08)

### 1. [FIXED] Resume branches from stale tree position
When agent teams spawns subagent CLI processes, they write to the same session JSONL. On subsequent `query()` resumes, the CLI reads the JSONL but may pick a stale branch tip (from before the subagent activity), causing the agent's response to land on a branch the host never receives a `result` for. **Fix**: pass `resumeSessionAt` with the last assistant message UUID to explicitly anchor each resume.

### 2. IDLE_TIMEOUT == CONTAINER_TIMEOUT (both 30 min)
Both timers fire at the same time, so containers always exit via hard SIGKILL (code 137) instead of graceful `_close` sentinel shutdown. The idle timeout should be shorter (e.g., 5 min) so containers wind down between messages, while container timeout stays at 30 min as a safety net for stuck agents.

### 3. Cursor advanced before agent succeeds
`processGroupMessages` advances `lastAgentTimestamp` before the agent runs. If the container times out, retries find no messages (cursor already past them). Messages are permanently lost on timeout.

### 4. Kubernetes image garbage collection deletes nanoclaw-agent image

**Symptoms**: `Container exited with code 125: pull access denied for nanoclaw-agent` — the container image disappears overnight or after a few hours, even though you just built it.

**Cause**: If your container runtime has Kubernetes enabled (Rancher Desktop enables it by default), the kubelet runs image garbage collection when disk usage exceeds 85%. NanoClaw containers are ephemeral (run and exit), so `nanoclaw-agent:latest` is never protected by a running container. The kubelet sees it as unused and deletes it — often overnight when no messages are being processed. Other images (docker-compose services) survive because they have long-running containers referencing them.

**Fix**: Disable Kubernetes if you don't need it:
```bash
# Rancher Desktop
rdctl set --kubernetes-enabled=false

# Then rebuild the container image
./container/build.sh
```

**Diagnosis**: Check the k3s log for image GC activity:
```bash
grep -i "nanoclaw" ~/Library/Logs/rancher-desktop/k3s.log
# Look for: "Removing image to free bytes" with the nanoclaw-agent image ID
```

Check NanoClaw logs for image status:
```bash
grep -E "image found|image NOT found|image missing" logs/nanoclaw.log
```

If you need Kubernetes enabled, set `CONTAINER_IMAGE` to an image stored in a registry that the kubelet won't GC, or raise the GC thresholds.

## Quick Status Check

```bash
# 1. Is the service running?
launchctl list | grep nanoclaw
# Expected: PID  0  com.nanoclaw (PID = running, "-" = not running, non-zero exit = crashed)

# 2. Any running containers?
docker ps --format '{{.Names}} {{.Status}}' 2>/dev/null | grep nanoclaw

# 3. Any stopped/orphaned containers?
docker ps -a --format '{{.Names}} {{.Status}}' 2>/dev/null | grep nanoclaw

# 4. Recent errors in service log?
grep -E 'ERROR|WARN' logs/nanoclaw.log | tail -20

# 5. Are channels connected? (look for last connection event)
grep -E 'Connected|Connection closed|connection.*close|channel.*ready' logs/nanoclaw.log | tail -5

# 6. Are groups loaded?
grep 'groupCount' logs/nanoclaw.log | tail -3
```

## Session Transcript Branching

```bash
# Check for concurrent CLI processes in session debug logs
ls -la data/sessions/<group>/.claude/debug/

# Count unique SDK processes that handled messages
# Each .txt file = one CLI subprocess. Multiple = concurrent queries.

# Check parentUuid branching in transcript
python3 -c "
import json, sys
lines = open('data/sessions/<group>/.claude/projects/-workspace-group/<session>.jsonl').read().strip().split('\n')
for i, line in enumerate(lines):
  try:
    d = json.loads(line)
    if d.get('type') == 'user' and d.get('message'):
      parent = d.get('parentUuid', 'ROOT')[:8]
      content = str(d['message'].get('content', ''))[:60]
      print(f'L{i+1} parent={parent} {content}')
  except: pass
"
```

## Container Timeout Investigation

```bash
# Check for recent timeouts
grep -E 'Container timeout|timed out' logs/nanoclaw.log | tail -10

# Check container log files for the timed-out container
ls -lt groups/*/logs/container-*.log | head -10

# Read the most recent container log (replace path)
cat groups/<group>/logs/container-<timestamp>.log

# Check if retries were scheduled and what happened
grep -E 'Scheduling retry|retry|Max retries' logs/nanoclaw.log | tail -10
```

## Agent Not Responding

```bash
# Check if messages are being received from channels
grep 'New messages' logs/nanoclaw.log | tail -10

# Check if messages are being processed (container spawned)
grep -E 'Processing messages|Spawning container' logs/nanoclaw.log | tail -10

# Check if messages are being piped to active container
grep -E 'Piped messages|sendMessage' logs/nanoclaw.log | tail -10

# Check the queue state — any active containers?
grep -E 'Starting container|Container active|concurrency limit' logs/nanoclaw.log | tail -10

# Check lastAgentTimestamp vs latest message timestamp
sqlite3 store/messages.db "SELECT chat_jid, MAX(timestamp) as latest FROM messages GROUP BY chat_jid ORDER BY latest DESC LIMIT 5;"
```

## Container Mount Issues

```bash
# Check mount validation logs (shows on container spawn)
grep -E 'Mount validated|Mount.*REJECTED|mount' logs/nanoclaw.log | tail -10

# Verify the mount allowlist is readable
cat ~/.config/nanoclaw/mount-allowlist.json

# Check group's container_config in DB
sqlite3 store/messages.db "SELECT name, container_config FROM registered_groups;"

# Test-run a container to check mounts (dry run)
# Replace <group-folder> with the group's folder name
docker run -i --rm --entrypoint ls nanoclaw-agent:latest /workspace/extra/
```

## Channel Auth Issues

```bash
# Check if QR code was requested (means auth expired)
grep 'QR\|authentication required\|qr' logs/nanoclaw.log | tail -5

# Check auth files exist
ls -la store/auth/

# Re-authenticate if needed
npm run auth
```

## Service Management

```bash
# Restart the service
launchctl kickstart -k gui/$(id -u)/com.nanoclaw

# View live logs
tail -f logs/nanoclaw.log

# Stop the service (careful — running containers are detached, not killed)
launchctl bootout gui/$(id -u)/com.nanoclaw

# Start the service
launchctl bootstrap gui/$(id -u) ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.nanoclaw.plist

# Rebuild after code changes
npm run build && launchctl kickstart -k gui/$(id -u)/com.nanoclaw
```
```

## File: `docs/docker-sandboxes.md`
```markdown
# Running NanoClaw in Docker Sandboxes (Manual Setup)

This guide walks through setting up NanoClaw inside a [Docker Sandbox](https://docs.docker.com/ai/sandboxes/) from scratch — no install script, no pre-built fork. You'll clone the upstream repo, apply the necessary patches, and have agents running in full hypervisor-level isolation.

## Architecture

```
Host (macOS / Windows WSL)
└── Docker Sandbox (micro VM with isolated kernel)
    ├── NanoClaw process (Node.js)
    │   ├── Channel adapters (WhatsApp, Telegram, etc.)
    │   └── Container spawner → nested Docker daemon
    └── Docker-in-Docker
        └── nanoclaw-agent containers
            └── Claude Agent SDK
```

Each agent runs in its own container, inside a micro VM that is fully isolated from your host. Two layers of isolation: per-agent containers + the VM boundary.

The sandbox provides a MITM proxy at `host.docker.internal:3128` that handles network access and injects your Anthropic API key automatically.

> **Note:** This guide is based on a validated setup running on macOS (Apple Silicon) with WhatsApp. Other channels (Telegram, Slack, etc.) and environments (Windows WSL) may require additional proxy patches for their specific HTTP/WebSocket clients. The core patches (container runner, credential proxy, Dockerfile) apply universally — channel-specific proxy configuration varies.

## Prerequisites

- **Docker Desktop v4.40+** with Sandbox support
- **Anthropic API key** (the sandbox proxy manages injection)
- For **Telegram**: a bot token from [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather) and your chat ID
- For **WhatsApp**: a phone with WhatsApp installed

Verify sandbox support:
```bash
docker sandbox version
```

## Step 1: Create the Sandbox

On your host machine:

```bash
# Create a workspace directory
mkdir -p ~/nanoclaw-workspace

# Create a shell sandbox with the workspace mounted
docker sandbox create shell ~/nanoclaw-workspace
```

If you're using WhatsApp, configure proxy bypass so WhatsApp's Noise protocol isn't MITM-inspected:

```bash
docker sandbox network proxy shell-nanoclaw-workspace \
  --bypass-host web.whatsapp.com \
  --bypass-host "*.whatsapp.com" \
  --bypass-host "*.whatsapp.net"
```

Telegram does not need proxy bypass.

Enter the sandbox:
```bash
docker sandbox run shell-nanoclaw-workspace
```

## Step 2: Install Prerequisites

Inside the sandbox:

```bash
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y build-essential python3
npm config set strict-ssl false
```

## Step 3: Clone and Install NanoClaw

NanoClaw must live inside the workspace directory — Docker-in-Docker can only bind-mount from the shared workspace path.

```bash
# Clone to home first (virtiofs can corrupt git pack files during clone)
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/qwibitai/nanoclaw.git

# Replace with YOUR workspace path (the host path you passed to `docker sandbox create`)
WORKSPACE=/Users/you/nanoclaw-workspace

# Move into workspace so DinD mounts work
mv nanoclaw "$WORKSPACE/nanoclaw"
cd "$WORKSPACE/nanoclaw"

# Install dependencies
npm install
npm install https-proxy-agent
```

## Step 4: Apply Proxy and Sandbox Patches

NanoClaw needs several patches to work inside a Docker Sandbox. These handle proxy routing, CA certificates, and Docker-in-Docker mount restrictions.

### 4a. Dockerfile — proxy args for container image build

`npm install` inside `docker build` fails with `SELF_SIGNED_CERT_IN_CHAIN` because the sandbox's MITM proxy presents its own certificate. Add proxy build args to `container/Dockerfile`:

Add these lines after the `FROM` line:

```dockerfile
# Accept proxy build args
ARG http_proxy
ARG https_proxy
ARG no_proxy
ARG NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS
ARG npm_config_strict_ssl=true
RUN npm config set strict-ssl ${npm_config_strict_ssl}
```

And after the `RUN npm install` line:

```dockerfile
RUN npm config set strict-ssl true
```

### 4b. Build script — forward proxy args

Patch `container/build.sh` to pass proxy env vars to `docker build`:

Add these `--build-arg` flags to the `docker build` command:

```bash
--build-arg http_proxy="${http_proxy:-$HTTP_PROXY}" \
--build-arg https_proxy="${https_proxy:-$HTTPS_PROXY}" \
--build-arg no_proxy="${no_proxy:-$NO_PROXY}" \
--build-arg npm_config_strict_ssl=false \
```

### 4c. Container runner — proxy forwarding, CA cert mount, /dev/null fix

Three changes to `src/container-runner.ts`:

**Replace `/dev/null` shadow mount.** The sandbox rejects `/dev/null` bind mounts. Find where `.env` is shadow-mounted to `/dev/null` and replace it with an empty file:

```typescript
// Create an empty file to shadow .env (Docker Sandbox rejects /dev/null mounts)
const emptyEnvPath = path.join(DATA_DIR, 'empty-env');
if (!fs.existsSync(emptyEnvPath)) fs.writeFileSync(emptyEnvPath, '');
// Use emptyEnvPath instead of '/dev/null' in the mount
```

**Forward proxy env vars** to spawned agent containers. Add `-e` flags for `HTTP_PROXY`, `HTTPS_PROXY`, `NO_PROXY` and their lowercase variants.

**Mount CA certificate.** If `NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS` or `SSL_CERT_FILE` is set, copy the cert into the project directory and mount it into agent containers:

```typescript
const caCertSrc = process.env.NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS || process.env.SSL_CERT_FILE;
if (caCertSrc) {
  const certDir = path.join(DATA_DIR, 'ca-cert');
  fs.mkdirSync(certDir, { recursive: true });
  fs.copyFileSync(caCertSrc, path.join(certDir, 'proxy-ca.crt'));
  // Mount: certDir -> /workspace/ca-cert (read-only)
  // Set NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS=/workspace/ca-cert/proxy-ca.crt in the container
}
```

### 4d. Container runtime — prevent self-termination

In `src/container-runtime.ts`, the `cleanupOrphans()` function matches containers by the `nanoclaw-` prefix. Inside a sandbox, the sandbox container itself may match (e.g., `nanoclaw-docker-sandbox`). Filter out the current hostname:

```typescript
// In cleanupOrphans(), filter out os.hostname() from the list of containers to stop
```

### 4e. Credential proxy — route through MITM proxy

In `src/credential-proxy.ts`, upstream API requests need to go through the sandbox proxy. Add `HttpsProxyAgent` to outbound requests:

```typescript
import { HttpsProxyAgent } from 'https-proxy-agent';

const proxyUrl = process.env.HTTPS_PROXY || process.env.https_proxy;
const upstreamAgent = proxyUrl ? new HttpsProxyAgent(proxyUrl) : undefined;
// Pass upstreamAgent to https.request() options
```

### 4f. Setup script — proxy build args

Patch `setup/container.ts` to pass the same proxy `--build-arg` flags as `build.sh` (Step 4b).

## Step 5: Build

```bash
npm run build
bash container/build.sh
```

## Step 6: Add a Channel

### Telegram

```bash
# Apply the Telegram skill
npx tsx scripts/apply-skill.ts .claude/skills/add-telegram

# Rebuild after applying the skill
npm run build

# Configure .env
cat > .env << EOF
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=<your-token-from-botfather>
ASSISTANT_NAME=nanoclaw
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=proxy-managed
EOF
mkdir -p data/env && cp .env data/env/env

# Register your chat
npx tsx setup/index.ts --step register \
  --jid "tg:<your-chat-id>" \
  --name "My Chat" \
  --trigger "@nanoclaw" \
  --folder "telegram_main" \
  --channel telegram \
  --assistant-name "nanoclaw" \
  --is-main \
  --no-trigger-required
```

**To find your chat ID:** Send any message to your bot, then:
```bash
curl -s --proxy $HTTPS_PROXY "https://api.telegram.org/bot<TOKEN>/getUpdates" | python3 -m json.tool
```

**Telegram in groups:** Disable Group Privacy in @BotFather (`/mybots` > Bot Settings > Group Privacy > Turn off), then remove and re-add the bot.

**Important:** If the Telegram skill creates `src/channels/telegram.ts`, you'll need to patch it for proxy support. Add an `HttpsProxyAgent` and pass it to grammy's `Bot` constructor via `baseFetchConfig.agent`. Then rebuild.

### WhatsApp

Make sure you configured proxy bypass in [Step 1](#step-1-create-the-sandbox) first.

```bash
# Apply the WhatsApp skill
npx tsx scripts/apply-skill.ts .claude/skills/add-whatsapp

# Rebuild
npm run build

# Configure .env
cat > .env << EOF
ASSISTANT_NAME=nanoclaw
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=proxy-managed
EOF
mkdir -p data/env && cp .env data/env/env

# Authenticate (choose one):

# QR code — scan with WhatsApp camera:
npx tsx src/whatsapp-auth.ts

# OR pairing code — enter code in WhatsApp > Linked Devices > Link with phone number:
npx tsx src/whatsapp-auth.ts --pairing-code --phone <phone-number-no-plus>

# Register your chat (JID = your phone number + @s.whatsapp.net)
npx tsx setup/index.ts --step register \
  --jid "<phone>@s.whatsapp.net" \
  --name "My Chat" \
  --trigger "@nanoclaw" \
  --folder "whatsapp_main" \
  --channel whatsapp \
  --assistant-name "nanoclaw" \
  --is-main \
  --no-trigger-required
```

**Important:** The WhatsApp skill files (`src/channels/whatsapp.ts` and `src/whatsapp-auth.ts`) also need proxy patches — add `HttpsProxyAgent` for WebSocket connections and a proxy-aware version fetch. Then rebuild.

### Both Channels

Apply both skills, patch both for proxy support, combine the `.env` variables, and register each chat separately.

## Step 7: Run

```bash
npm start
```

You don't need to set `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` manually. The sandbox proxy intercepts requests and replaces `proxy-managed` with your real key automatically.

## Networking Details

### How the proxy works

All traffic from the sandbox routes through the host proxy at `host.docker.internal:3128`:

```
Agent container → DinD bridge → Sandbox VM → host.docker.internal:3128 → Host proxy → api.anthropic.com
```

**"Bypass" does not mean traffic skips the proxy.** It means the proxy passes traffic through without MITM inspection. Node.js doesn't automatically use `HTTP_PROXY` env vars — you need explicit `HttpsProxyAgent` configuration in every HTTP/WebSocket client.

### Shared paths for DinD mounts

Only the workspace directory is available for Docker-in-Docker bind mounts. Paths outside the workspace fail with "path not shared":
- `/dev/null` → replace with an empty file in the project dir
- `/usr/local/share/ca-certificates/` → copy cert to project dir
- `/home/agent/` → clone to workspace instead

### Git clone and virtiofs

The workspace is mounted via virtiofs. Git's pack file handling can corrupt over virtiofs during clone. Workaround: clone to `/home/agent` first, then `mv` into the workspace.

## Troubleshooting

### npm install fails with SELF_SIGNED_CERT_IN_CHAIN
```bash
npm config set strict-ssl false
```

### Container build fails with proxy errors
```bash
docker build \
  --build-arg http_proxy=$http_proxy \
  --build-arg https_proxy=$https_proxy \
  -t nanoclaw-agent:latest container/
```

### Agent containers fail with "path not shared"
All bind-mounted paths must be under the workspace directory. Check:
- Is NanoClaw cloned into the workspace? (not `/home/agent/`)
- Is the CA cert copied to the project root?
- Has the empty `.env` shadow file been created?

### Agent containers can't reach Anthropic API
Verify proxy env vars are forwarded to agent containers. Check container logs for `HTTP_PROXY=http://host.docker.internal:3128`.

### WhatsApp error 405
The version fetch is returning a stale version. Make sure the proxy-aware `fetchWaVersionViaProxy` patch is applied — it fetches `sw.js` through `HttpsProxyAgent` and parses `client_revision`.

### WhatsApp "Connection failed" immediately
Proxy bypass not configured. From the **host**, run:
```bash
docker sandbox network proxy <sandbox-name> \
  --bypass-host web.whatsapp.com \
  --bypass-host "*.whatsapp.com" \
  --bypass-host "*.whatsapp.net"
```

### Telegram bot doesn't receive messages
1. Check the grammy proxy patch is applied (look for `HttpsProxyAgent` in `src/channels/telegram.ts`)
2. Check Group Privacy is disabled in @BotFather if using in groups

### Git clone fails with "inflate: data stream error"
Clone to a non-workspace path first, then move:
```bash
cd ~ && git clone https://github.com/qwibitai/nanoclaw.git && mv nanoclaw /path/to/workspace/nanoclaw
```

### WhatsApp QR code doesn't display
Run the auth command interactively inside the sandbox (not piped through `docker sandbox exec`):
```bash
docker sandbox run shell-nanoclaw-workspace
# Then inside:
npx tsx src/whatsapp-auth.ts
```
```

# NanoClaw Requirements

Original requirements and design decisions from the project creator.

---

## Why This Exists

This is a lightweight, secure alternative to OpenClaw (formerly ClawBot). That project became a monstrosity - 4-5 different processes running different gateways, endless configuration files, endless integrations. It's a security nightmare where agents don't run in isolated processes; there's all kinds of leaky workarounds trying to prevent them from accessing parts of the system they shouldn't. It's impossible for anyone to realistically understand the whole codebase. When you run it you're kind of just yoloing it.

NanoClaw gives you the core functionality without that mess.

---

## Philosophy

### Small Enough to Understand

The entire codebase should be something you can read and understand. One Node.js process. A handful of source files. No microservices, no message queues, no abstraction layers.

### Security Through True Isolation

Instead of application-level permission systems trying to prevent agents from accessing things, agents run in actual Linux containers. The isolation is at the OS level. Agents can only see what's explicitly mounted. Bash access is safe because commands run inside the container, not on your Mac.

### Built for the Individual User

This isn't a framework or a platform. It's software that fits each user's exact needs. You fork the repo, add the channels you want (WhatsApp, Telegram, Discord, Slack, Gmail), and end up with clean code that does exactly what you need.

### Customization = Code Changes

No configuration sprawl. If you want different behavior, modify the code. The codebase is small enough that this is safe and practical. Very minimal things like the trigger word are in config. Everything else - just change the code to do what you want.

### AI-Native Development

I don't need an installation wizard - Claude Code guides the setup. I don't need a monitoring dashboard - I ask Claude Code what's happening. I don't need elaborate logging UIs - I ask Claude to read the logs. I don't need debugging tools - I describe the problem and Claude fixes it.

The codebase assumes you have an AI collaborator. It doesn't need to be excessively self-documenting or self-debugging because Claude is always there.

### Skills Over Features

When people contribute, they shouldn't add "Telegram support alongside WhatsApp." They should contribute a skill like `/add-telegram` that transforms the codebase. Users fork the repo, run skills to customize, and end up with clean code that does exactly what they need - not a bloated system trying to support everyone's use case simultaneously.

---

## RFS (Request for Skills)

Skills we'd like to see contributed:

### Communication Channels
- `/add-signal` - Add Signal as a channel
- `/add-matrix` - Add Matrix integration

> **Note:** Telegram, Slack, Discord, Gmail, and Apple Container skills already exist. See the [skills documentation](https://docs.nanoclaw.dev/integrations/skills-system) for the full list.

---

## Vision

A personal Claude assistant accessible via messaging, with minimal custom code.

**Core components:**
- **Claude Agent SDK** as the core agent
- **Containers** for isolated agent execution (Linux VMs)
- **Multi-channel messaging** (WhatsApp, Telegram, Discord, Slack, Gmail) — add exactly the channels you need
- **Persistent memory** per conversation and globally
- **Scheduled tasks** that run Claude and can message back
- **Web access** for search and browsing
- **Browser automation** via agent-browser

**Implementation approach:**
- Use existing tools (channel libraries, Claude Agent SDK, MCP servers)
- Minimal glue code
- File-based systems where possible (CLAUDE.md for memory, folders for groups)

---

## Architecture Decisions

### Message Routing
- A router listens to connected channels and routes messages based on configuration
- Only messages from registered groups are processed
- Trigger: `@Andy` prefix (case insensitive), configurable via `ASSISTANT_NAME` env var
- Unregistered groups are ignored completely

### Memory System
- **Per-group memory**: Each group has a folder with its own `CLAUDE.md`
- **Global memory**: Root `CLAUDE.md` is read by all groups, but only writable from "main" (self-chat)
- **Files**: Groups can create/read files in their folder and reference them
- Agent runs in the group's folder, automatically inherits both CLAUDE.md files

### Session Management
- Each group maintains a conversation session (via Claude Agent SDK)
- Sessions auto-compact when context gets too long, preserving critical information

### Container Isolation
- All agents run inside containers (lightweight Linux VMs)
- Each agent invocation spawns a container with mounted directories
- Containers provide filesystem isolation - agents can only see mounted paths
- Bash access is safe because commands run inside the container, not on the host
- Browser automation via agent-browser with Chromium in the container

### Scheduled Tasks
- Users can ask Claude to schedule recurring or one-time tasks from any group
- Tasks run as full agents in the context of the group that created them
- Tasks have access to all tools including Bash (safe in container)
- Tasks can optionally send messages to their group via `send_message` tool, or complete silently
- Task runs are logged to the database with duration and result
- Schedule types: cron expressions, intervals (ms), or one-time (ISO timestamp)
- From main: can schedule tasks for any group, view/manage all tasks
- From other groups: can only manage that group's tasks

### Group Management
- New groups are added explicitly via the main channel
- Groups are registered in SQLite (via the main channel or IPC `register_group` command)
- Each group gets a dedicated folder under `groups/`
- Groups can have additional directories mounted via `containerConfig`

### Main Channel Privileges
- Main channel is the admin/control group (typically self-chat)
- Can write to global memory (`groups/CLAUDE.md`)
- Can schedule tasks for any group
- Can view and manage tasks from all groups
- Can configure additional directory mounts for any group

---

## Integration Points

### Channels
- WhatsApp (baileys), Telegram (grammy), Discord (discord.js), Slack (@slack/bolt), Gmail (googleapis)
- Each channel lives in a separate fork repo and is added via skills (e.g., `/add-whatsapp`, `/add-telegram`)
- Messages stored in SQLite, polled by router
- Channels self-register at startup — unconfigured channels are skipped with a warning

### Scheduler
- Built-in scheduler runs on the host, spawns containers for task execution
- Custom `nanoclaw` MCP server (inside container) provides scheduling tools
- Tools: `schedule_task`, `list_tasks`, `pause_task`, `resume_task`, `cancel_task`, `send_message`
- Tasks stored in SQLite with run history
- Scheduler loop checks for due tasks every minute
- Tasks execute Claude Agent SDK in containerized group context

### Web Access
- Built-in WebSearch and WebFetch tools
- Standard Claude Agent SDK capabilities

### Browser Automation
- agent-browser CLI with Chromium in container
- Snapshot-based interaction with element references (@e1, @e2, etc.)
- Screenshots, PDFs, video recording
- Authentication state persistence

---

## Setup & Customization

### Philosophy
- Minimal configuration files
- Setup and customization done via Claude Code
- Users clone the repo and run Claude Code to configure
- Each user gets a custom setup matching their exact needs

### Skills
- `/setup` - Install dependencies, configure channels, start services
- `/customize` - General-purpose skill for adding capabilities
- `/update-nanoclaw` - Pull upstream changes, merge with customizations

### Deployment
- Runs on macOS (launchd), Linux (systemd), or Windows (WSL2)
- Single Node.js process handles everything

---

## Personal Configuration (Reference)

These are the creator's settings, stored here for reference:

- **Trigger**: `@Andy` (case insensitive)
- **Response prefix**: `Andy:`
- **Persona**: Default Claude (no custom personality)
- **Main channel**: Self-chat (messaging yourself in WhatsApp)

## Project Name

**NanoClaw** - A reference to Clawdbot (now OpenClaw).

# Claude Agent SDK Deep Dive

Findings from reverse-engineering `@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk` v0.2.29–0.2.34 to understand how `query()` works, why agent teams subagents were being killed, and how to fix it. Supplemented with official SDK reference docs.

## Architecture

```
Agent Runner (our code)
  └── query() → SDK (sdk.mjs)
        └── spawns CLI subprocess (cli.js)
              └── Claude API calls, tool execution
              └── Task tool → spawns subagent subprocesses
```

The SDK spawns `cli.js` as a child process with `--output-format stream-json --input-format stream-json --print --verbose` flags. Communication happens via JSON-lines on stdin/stdout.

`query()` returns a `Query` object extending `AsyncGenerator<SDKMessage, void>`. Internally:

- SDK spawns CLI as a child process, communicates via stdin/stdout JSON lines
- SDK's `readMessages()` reads from CLI stdout, enqueues into internal stream
- `readSdkMessages()` async generator yields from that stream
- `[Symbol.asyncIterator]` returns `readSdkMessages()`
- Iterator returns `done: true` only when CLI closes stdout

Both V1 (`query()`) and V2 (`createSession`/`send`/`stream`) use the exact same three-layer architecture:

```
SDK (sdk.mjs)           CLI Process (cli.js)
--------------          --------------------
XX Transport  ------>   stdin reader (bd1)
  (spawn cli.js)           |
$X Query      <------   stdout writer
  (JSON-lines)             |
                        EZ() recursive generator
                           |
                        Anthropic Messages API
```

## The Core Agent Loop (EZ)

Inside the CLI, the agentic loop is a **recursive async generator called `EZ()`**, not an iterative while loop:

```
EZ({ messages, systemPrompt, canUseTool, maxTurns, turnCount=1, ... })
```

Each invocation = one API call to Claude (one "turn").

### Flow per turn:

1. **Prepare messages** — trim context, run compaction if needed
2. **Call the Anthropic API** (via `mW1` streaming function)
3. **Extract tool_use blocks** from the response
4. **Branch:**
   - If **no tool_use blocks** → stop (run stop hooks, return)
   - If **tool_use blocks present** → execute tools, increment turnCount, recurse

All complex logic — the agent loop, tool execution, background tasks, teammate orchestration — runs inside the CLI subprocess. `query()` is a thin transport wrapper.

### PermissionMode

```typescript
type PermissionMode = 'default' | 'acceptEdits' | 'bypassPermissions' | 'plan';
```

### SettingSource

```typescript
type SettingSource = 'user' | 'project' | 'local';
// 'user'    → ~/.claude/settings.json
// 'project' → .claude/settings.json (version controlled)
// 'local'   → .claude/settings.local.json (gitignored)
```

When omitted, SDK loads NO filesystem settings (isolation by default). Precedence: local > project > user. Programmatic options always override filesystem settings.

### AgentDefinition

Programmatic subagents (NOT agent teams — these are simpler, no inter-agent coordination):

```typescript
type AgentDefinition = {
  description: string;  // When to use this agent
  tools?: string[];     // Allowed tools (inherits all if omitted)
  prompt: string;       // Agent's system prompt
  model?: 'sonnet' | 'opus' | 'haiku' | 'inherit';
}
```

### McpServerConfig

```typescript
type McpServerConfig =
  | { type?: 'stdio'; command: string; args?: string[]; env?: Record<string, string> }
  | { type: 'sse'; url: string; headers?: Record<string, string> }
  | { type: 'http'; url: string; headers?: Record<string, string> }
  | { type: 'sdk'; name: string; instance: McpServer }  // in-process
```

### SdkBeta

```typescript
type SdkBeta = 'context-1m-2025-08-07';
// Enables 1M token context window for Opus 4.6, Sonnet 4.5, Sonnet 4
```

### CanUseTool

```typescript
type CanUseTool = (
  toolName: string,
  input: ToolInput,
  options: { signal: AbortSignal; suggestions?: PermissionUpdate[] }
) => Promise<PermissionResult>;

type PermissionResult =
  | { behavior: 'allow'; updatedInput: ToolInput; updatedPermissions?: PermissionUpdate[] }
  | { behavior: 'deny'; message: string; interrupt?: boolean };
```

## SDKMessage Types

`query()` can yield 16 message types. The official docs show a simplified union of 7, but `sdk.d.ts` has the full set:

| Type | Subtype | Purpose |
|------|---------|---------|
| `system` | `init` | Session initialized, contains session_id, tools, model |
| `system` | `task_notification` | Background agent completed/failed/stopped |
| `system` | `compact_boundary` | Conversation was compacted |
| `system` | `status` | Status change (e.g. compacting) |
| `system` | `hook_started` | Hook execution started |
| `system` | `hook_progress` | Hook progress output |
| `system` | `hook_response` | Hook completed |
| `system` | `files_persisted` | Files saved |
| `assistant` | — | Claude's response (text + tool calls) |
| `user` | — | User message (internal) |
| `user` (replay) | — | Replayed user message on resume |
| `result` | `success` / `error_*` | Final result of a prompt processing round |
| `stream_event` | — | Partial streaming (when includePartialMessages) |
| `tool_progress` | — | Long-running tool progress |
| `auth_status` | — | Authentication state changes |
| `tool_use_summary` | — | Summary of preceding tool uses |

### SDKTaskNotificationMessage (sdk.d.ts:1507)

```typescript
type SDKTaskNotificationMessage = {
  type: 'system';
  subtype: 'task_notification';
  task_id: string;
  status: 'completed' | 'failed' | 'stopped';
  output_file: string;
  summary: string;
  uuid: UUID;
  session_id: string;
};
```

### SDKResultMessage (sdk.d.ts:1375)

Two variants with shared fields:

```typescript
// Shared fields on both variants:
// uuid, session_id, duration_ms, duration_api_ms, is_error, num_turns,
// total_cost_usd, usage: NonNullableUsage, modelUsage, permission_denials

// Success:
type SDKResultSuccess = {
  type: 'result';
  subtype: 'success';
  result: string;
  structured_output?: unknown;
  // ...shared fields
};

// Error:
type SDKResultError = {
  type: 'result';
  subtype: 'error_during_execution' | 'error_max_turns' | 'error_max_budget_usd' | 'error_max_structured_output_retries';
  errors: string[];
  // ...shared fields
};
```

Useful fields on result: `total_cost_usd`, `duration_ms`, `num_turns`, `modelUsage` (per-model breakdown with `costUSD`, `inputTokens`, `outputTokens`, `contextWindow`).

### SDKAssistantMessage

```typescript
type SDKAssistantMessage = {
  type: 'assistant';
  uuid: UUID;
  session_id: string;
  message: APIAssistantMessage; // From Anthropic SDK
  parent_tool_use_id: string | null; // Non-null when from subagent
};
```

### SDKSystemMessage (init)

```typescript
type SDKSystemMessage = {
  type: 'system';
  subtype: 'init';
  uuid: UUID;
  session_id: string;
  apiKeySource: ApiKeySource;
  cwd: string;
  tools: string[];
  mcp_servers: { name: string; status: string }[];
  model: string;
  permissionMode: PermissionMode;
  slash_commands: string[];
  output_style: string;
};
```

## Turn Behavior: When the Agent Stops vs Continues

### When the Agent STOPS (no more API calls)

**1. No tool_use blocks in response (THE PRIMARY CASE)**

Claude responded with text only — it decided it has completed the task. The API's `stop_reason` will be `"end_turn"`. The SDK does NOT make this decision — it's entirely driven by Claude's model output.

**2. Max turns exceeded** — Results in `SDKResultError` with `subtype: "error_max_turns"`.

**3. Abort signal** — User interruption via `abortController`.

**4. Budget exceeded** — `totalCost >= maxBudgetUsd` → `"error_max_budget_usd"`.

**5. Stop hook prevents continuation** — Hook returns `{preventContinuation: true}`.

### When the Agent CONTINUES (makes another API call)

**1. Response contains tool_use blocks (THE PRIMARY CASE)** — Execute tools, increment turnCount, recurse into EZ.

**2. max_output_tokens recovery** — Up to 3 retries with a "break your work into smaller pieces" context message.

**3. Stop hook blocking errors** — Errors fed back as context messages, loop continues.

**4. Model fallback** — Retry with fallback model (one-time).

### Decision Table

| Condition | Action | Result Type |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| Response has `tool_use` blocks | Execute tools, recurse into `EZ` | continues |
| Response has NO `tool_use` blocks | Run stop hooks, return | `success` |
| `turnCount > maxTurns` | Yield max_turns_reached | `error_max_turns` |
| `totalCost >= maxBudgetUsd` | Yield budget error | `error_max_budget_usd` |
| `abortController.signal.aborted` | Yield interrupted msg | depends on context |
| `stop_reason === "max_tokens"` (output) | Retry up to 3x with recovery prompt | continues |
| Stop hook `preventContinuation` | Return immediately | `success` |
| Stop hook blocking error | Feed error back, recurse | continues |
| Model fallback error | Retry with fallback model (one-time) | continues |

## Subagent Execution Modes

### Case 1: Synchronous Subagents (`run_in_background: false`) — BLOCKS

Parent agent calls Task tool → `VR()` runs `EZ()` for subagent → parent waits for full result → tool result returned to parent → parent continues.

The subagent runs the full recursive EZ loop. The parent's tool execution is suspended via `await`. There is a mid-execution "promotion" mechanism: a synchronous subagent can be promoted to background via `Promise.race()` against a `backgroundSignal` promise.

### Case 2: Background Tasks (`run_in_background: true`) — DOES NOT WAIT

- **Bash tool:** Command spawned, tool returns immediately with empty result + `backgroundTaskId`
- **Task/Agent tool:** Subagent launched in fire-and-forget wrapper (`g01()`), tool returns immediately with `status: "async_launched"` + `outputFile` path

Zero "wait for background tasks" logic before emitting the `type: "result"` message. When a background task completes, an `SDKTaskNotificationMessage` is emitted separately.

### Case 3: Agent Teams (TeammateTool / SendMessage) — RESULT FIRST, THEN POLLING

The team leader runs its normal EZ loop, which includes spawning teammates. When the leader's EZ loop finishes, `type: "result"` is emitted. Then the leader enters a post-result polling loop:

```javascript
while (true) {
    // Check if no active teammates AND no running tasks → break
    // Check for unread messages from teammates → re-inject as new prompt, restart EZ loop
    // If stdin closed with active teammates → inject shutdown prompt
    // Poll every 500ms
}
```

From the SDK consumer's perspective: you receive the initial `type: "result"`, but the AsyncGenerator may continue yielding more messages as the team leader processes teammate responses and re-enters the agent loop. The generator only truly finishes when all teammates have shut down.

## The isSingleUserTurn Problem

From sdk.mjs:

```javascript
QK = typeof X === "string"  // isSingleUserTurn = true when prompt is a string
```

When `isSingleUserTurn` is true and the first `result` message arrives:

```javascript
if (this.isSingleUserTurn) {
  this.transport.endInput();  // closes stdin to CLI
}
```

This triggers a chain reaction:

1. SDK closes CLI stdin
2. CLI detects stdin close
3. Polling loop sees `D = true` (stdin closed) with active teammates
4. Injects shutdown prompt → leader sends `shutdown_request` to all teammates
5. **Teammates get killed mid-research**

The shutdown prompt (found via `BGq` variable in minified cli.js):

```
You are running in non-interactive mode and cannot return a response
to the user until your team is shut down.

You MUST shut down your team before preparing your final response:
1. Use requestShutdown to ask each team member to shut down gracefully
2. Wait for shutdown approvals
3. Use the cleanup operation to clean up the team
4. Only then provide your final response to the user
```

### The practical problem

With V1 `query()` + string prompt + agent teams:

1. Leader spawns teammates, they start researching
2. Leader's EZ loop ends ("I've dispatched the team, they're working on it")
3. `type: "result"` emitted
4. SDK sees `isSingleUserTurn = true` → closes stdin immediately
5. Polling loop detects stdin closed + active teammates → injects shutdown prompt
6. Leader sends `shutdown_request` to all teammates
7. **Teammates could be 10 seconds into a 5-minute research task and they get told to stop**

## The Fix: Streaming Input Mode

Instead of passing a string prompt (which sets `isSingleUserTurn = true`), pass an `AsyncIterable<SDKUserMessage>`:

```typescript
// Before (broken for agent teams):
query({ prompt: "do something" })

// After (keeps CLI alive):
query({ prompt: asyncIterableOfMessages })
```

When prompt is an `AsyncIterable`:
- `isSingleUserTurn = false`
- SDK does NOT close stdin after first result
- CLI stays alive, continues processing
- Background agents keep running
- `task_notification` messages flow through the iterator
- We control when to end the iterable

### Additional Benefit: Streaming New Messages

With the async iterable approach, we can push new incoming WhatsApp messages into the iterable while the agent is still working. Instead of queuing messages until the container exits and spawning a new container, we stream them directly into the running session.

### Intended Lifecycle with Agent Teams

With the async iterable fix (`isSingleUserTurn = false`), stdin stays open so the CLI never hits the teammate check or shutdown prompt injection:

```
1. system/init          → session initialized
2. assistant/user       → Claude reasoning, tool calls, tool results
3. ...                  → more assistant/user turns (spawning subagents, etc.)
4. result #1            → lead agent's first response (capture)
5. task_notification(s) → background agents complete/fail/stop
6. assistant/user       → lead agent continues (processing subagent results)
7. result #2            → lead agent's follow-up response (capture)
8. [iterator done]      → CLI closed stdout, all done
```

All results are meaningful — capture every one, not just the first.

## V1 vs V2 API

### V1: `query()` — One-shot async generator

```typescript
const q = query({ prompt: "...", options: {...} });
for await (const msg of q) { /* process events */ }
```

- When `prompt` is a string: `isSingleUserTurn = true` → stdin auto-closes after first result
- For multi-turn: must pass an `AsyncIterable<SDKUserMessage>` and manage coordination yourself

### V2: `createSession()` + `send()` / `stream()` — Persistent session

```typescript
await using session = unstable_v2_createSession({ model: "..." });
await session.send("first message");
for await (const msg of session.stream()) { /* events */ }
await session.send("follow-up");
for await (const msg of session.stream()) { /* events */ }
```

- `isSingleUserTurn = false` always → stdin stays open
- `send()` enqueues into an async queue (`QX`)
- `stream()` yields from the same message generator, stopping on `result` type
- Multi-turn is natural — just alternate `send()` / `stream()`
- V2 does NOT call V1 `query()` internally — both independently create Transport + Query

### Comparison Table

| Aspect | V1 | V2 |
|--------|----|----|
| `isSingleUserTurn` | `true` for string prompt | always `false` |
| Multi-turn | Requires managing `AsyncIterable` | Just call `send()`/`stream()` |
| stdin lifecycle | Auto-closes after first result | Stays open until `close()` |
| Agentic loop | Identical `EZ()` | Identical `EZ()` |
| Stop conditions | Same | Same |
| Session persistence | Must pass `resume` to new `query()` | Built-in via session object |
| API stability | Stable | Unstable preview (`unstable_v2_*` prefix) |

**Key finding: Zero difference in turn behavior.** Both use the same CLI process, the same `EZ()` recursive generator, and the same decision logic.

## Hook Events

```typescript
type HookEvent =
  | 'PreToolUse'         // Before tool execution
  | 'PostToolUse'        // After successful tool execution
  | 'PostToolUseFailure' // After failed tool execution
  | 'Notification'       // Notification messages
  | 'UserPromptSubmit'   // User prompt submitted
  | 'SessionStart'       // Session started (startup/resume/clear/compact)
  | 'SessionEnd'         // Session ended
  | 'Stop'               // Agent stopping
  | 'SubagentStart'      // Subagent spawned
  | 'SubagentStop'       // Subagent stopped
  | 'PreCompact'         // Before conversation compaction
  | 'PermissionRequest'; // Permission being requested
```

### Hook Configuration

```typescript
interface HookCallbackMatcher {
  matcher?: string;      // Optional tool name matcher
  hooks: HookCallback[];
}

type HookCallback = (
  input: HookInput,
  toolUseID: string | undefined,
  options: { signal: AbortSignal }
) => Promise<HookJSONOutput>;
```

### Hook Return Values

```typescript
type HookJSONOutput = AsyncHookJSONOutput | SyncHookJSONOutput;

type AsyncHookJSONOutput = { async: true; asyncTimeout?: number };

type SyncHookJSONOutput = {
  continue?: boolean;
  suppressOutput?: boolean;
  stopReason?: string;
  decision?: 'approve' | 'block';
  systemMessage?: string;
  reason?: string;
  hookSpecificOutput?:
    | { hookEventName: 'PreToolUse'; permissionDecision?: 'allow' | 'deny' | 'ask'; updatedInput?: Record<string, unknown> }
    | { hookEventName: 'UserPromptSubmit'; additionalContext?: string }
    | { hookEventName: 'SessionStart'; additionalContext?: string }
    | { hookEventName: 'PostToolUse'; additionalContext?: string };
};
```

### Subagent Hooks (from sdk.d.ts)

```typescript
type SubagentStartHookInput = BaseHookInput & {
  hook_event_name: 'SubagentStart';
  agent_id: string;
  agent_type: string;
};

type SubagentStopHookInput = BaseHookInput & {
  hook_event_name: 'SubagentStop';
  stop_hook_active: boolean;
  agent_id: string;
  agent_transcript_path: string;
  agent_type: string;
};

// BaseHookInput = { session_id, transcript_path, cwd, permission_mode? }
```

## Query Interface Methods

The `Query` object (sdk.d.ts:931). Official docs list these public methods:

```typescript
interface Query extends AsyncGenerator<SDKMessage, void> {
  interrupt(): Promise<void>;                     // Stop current execution (streaming input mode only)
  rewindFiles(userMessageUuid: string): Promise<void>; // Restore files to state at message (needs enableFileCheckpointing)
  setPermissionMode(mode: PermissionMode): Promise<void>; // Change permissions (streaming input mode only)
  setModel(model?: string): Promise<void>;        // Change model (streaming input mode only)
  setMaxThinkingTokens(max: number | null): Promise<void>; // Change thinking tokens (streaming input mode only)
  supportedCommands(): Promise<SlashCommand[]>;   // Available slash commands
  supportedModels(): Promise<ModelInfo[]>;         // Available models
  mcpServerStatus(): Promise<McpServerStatus[]>;  // MCP server connection status
  accountInfo(): Promise<AccountInfo>;             // Authenticated user info
}
```

Found in sdk.d.ts but NOT in official docs (may be internal):
- `streamInput(stream)` — stream additional user messages
- `close()` — forcefully end the query
- `setMcpServers(servers)` — dynamically add/remove MCP servers

## Sandbox Configuration

```typescript
type SandboxSettings = {
  enabled?: boolean;
  autoAllowBashIfSandboxed?: boolean;
  excludedCommands?: string[];
  allowUnsandboxedCommands?: boolean;
  network?: {
    allowLocalBinding?: boolean;
    allowUnixSockets?: string[];
    allowAllUnixSockets?: boolean;
    httpProxyPort?: number;
    socksProxyPort?: number;
  };
  ignoreViolations?: {
    file?: string[];
    network?: string[];
  };
};
```

When `allowUnsandboxedCommands` is true, the model can set `dangerouslyDisableSandbox: true` in Bash tool input, which falls back to the `canUseTool` permission handler.

## MCP Server Helpers

### tool()

Creates type-safe MCP tool definitions with Zod schemas:

```typescript
function tool<Schema extends ZodRawShape>(
  name: string,
  description: string,
  inputSchema: Schema,
  handler: (args: z.infer<ZodObject<Schema>>, extra: unknown) => Promise<CallToolResult>
): SdkMcpToolDefinition<Schema>
```

### createSdkMcpServer()

Creates an in-process MCP server (we use stdio instead for subagent inheritance):

```typescript
function createSdkMcpServer(options: {
  name: string;
  version?: string;
  tools?: Array<SdkMcpToolDefinition<any>>;
}): McpSdkServerConfigWithInstance
```

## File: `docs/SECURITY.md`
```markdown
# NanoClaw Security Model

## Trust Model

| Entity | Trust Level | Rationale |
|--------|-------------|-----------|
| Main group | Trusted | Private self-chat, admin control |
| Non-main groups | Untrusted | Other users may be malicious |
| Container agents | Sandboxed | Isolated execution environment |
| Incoming messages | User input | Potential prompt injection |

## Security Boundaries

### 1. Container Isolation (Primary Boundary)

Agents execute in containers (lightweight Linux VMs), providing:
- **Process isolation** - Container processes cannot affect the host
- **Filesystem isolation** - Only explicitly mounted directories are visible
- **Non-root execution** - Runs as unprivileged `node` user (uid 1000)
- **Ephemeral containers** - Fresh environment per invocation (`--rm`)

This is the primary security boundary. Rather than relying on application-level permission checks, the attack surface is limited by what's mounted.

### 2. Mount Security

**External Allowlist** - Mount permissions stored at `~/.config/nanoclaw/mount-allowlist.json`, which is:
- Outside project root
- Never mounted into containers
- Cannot be modified by agents

**Default Blocked Patterns:**
```
.ssh, .gnupg, .aws, .azure, .gcloud, .kube, .docker,
credentials, .env, .netrc, .npmrc, id_rsa, id_ed25519,
private_key, .secret
```

**Protections:**
- Symlink resolution before validation (prevents traversal attacks)
- Container path validation (rejects `..` and absolute paths)
- `nonMainReadOnly` option forces read-only for non-main groups

**Read-Only Project Root:**

The main group's project root is mounted read-only. Writable paths the agent needs (group folder, IPC, `.claude/`) are mounted separately. This prevents the agent from modifying host application code (`src/`, `dist/`, `package.json`, etc.) which would bypass the sandbox entirely on next restart.

### 3. Session Isolation

Each group has isolated Claude sessions at `data/sessions/{group}/.claude/`:
- Groups cannot see other groups' conversation history
- Session data includes full message history and file contents read
- Prevents cross-group information disclosure

### 4. IPC Authorization

Messages and task operations are verified against group identity:

| Operation | Main Group | Non-Main Group |
|-----------|------------|----------------|
| Send message to own chat | ✓ | ✓ |
| Send message to other chats | ✓ | ✗ |
| Schedule task for self | ✓ | ✓ |
| Schedule task for others | ✓ | ✗ |
| View all tasks | ✓ | Own only |
| Manage other groups | ✓ | ✗ |

### 5. Credential Isolation (OneCLI Agent Vault)

Real API credentials **never enter containers**. NanoClaw uses [OneCLI's Agent Vault](https://github.com/onecli/onecli) to proxy outbound requests and inject credentials at the gateway level.

**How it works:**
1. Credentials are registered once with `onecli secrets create`, stored and managed by OneCLI
2. When NanoClaw spawns a container, it calls `applyContainerConfig()` to route outbound HTTPS through the OneCLI gateway
3. The gateway matches requests by host and path, injects the real credential, and forwards
4. Agents cannot discover real credentials — not in environment, stdin, files, or `/proc`

**Per-agent policies:**
Each NanoClaw group gets its own OneCLI agent identity. This allows different credential policies per group (e.g. your sales agent vs. support agent). OneCLI supports rate limits, and time-bound access and approval flows are on the roadmap.

**NOT Mounted:**
- Channel auth sessions (`store/auth/`) — host only
- Mount allowlist — external, never mounted
- Any credentials matching blocked patterns
- `.env` is shadowed with `/dev/null` in the project root mount

## Privilege Comparison

| Capability | Main Group | Non-Main Group |
|------------|------------|----------------|
| Project root access | `/workspace/project` (ro) | None |
| Group folder | `/workspace/group` (rw) | `/workspace/group` (rw) |
| Global memory | Implicit via project | `/workspace/global` (ro) |
| Additional mounts | Configurable | Read-only unless allowed |
| Network access | Unrestricted | Unrestricted |
| MCP tools | All | All |

# Skills as Branches

## Overview

This document covers **feature skills** — skills that add capabilities via git branch merges. This is the most complex skill type and the primary way NanoClaw is extended.

NanoClaw has four types of skills overall. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](../bmad_repo/CONTRIBUTING.md) for the full taxonomy:

| Type | Location | How it works |
|------|----------|-------------|
| **Feature** (this doc) | `.claude/skills/` + `skill/*` branch | SKILL.md has instructions; code lives on a branch, applied via `git merge` |
| **Utility** | `.claude/skills/<name>/` with code files | Self-contained tools; code in skill directory, copied into place on install |
| **Operational** | `.claude/skills/` on `main` | Instruction-only workflows (setup, debug, update) |
| **Container** | `container/skills/` | Loaded inside agent containers at runtime |

---

Feature skills are distributed as git branches on the upstream repository. Applying a skill is a `git merge`. Updating core is a `git merge`. Everything is standard git.

This replaces the previous `skills-engine/` system (three-way file merging, `.nanoclaw/` state, manifest files, replay, backup/restore) with plain git operations and Claude for conflict resolution.

## How It Works

### Repository structure

The upstream repo (`qwibitai/nanoclaw`) maintains:

- `main` — core NanoClaw (no skill code)
- `skill/discord` — main + Discord integration
- `skill/telegram` — main + Telegram integration
- `skill/slack` — main + Slack integration
- `skill/gmail` — main + Gmail integration
- etc.

Each skill branch contains all the code changes for that skill: new files, modified source files, updated `package.json` dependencies, `.env.example` additions — everything. No manifest, no structured operations, no separate `add/` and `modify/` directories.

### Skill discovery and installation

Skills are split into two categories:

**Operational skills** (on `main`, always available):
- `/setup`, `/debug`, `/update-nanoclaw`, `/customize`, `/update-skills`
- These are instruction-only SKILL.md files — no code changes, just workflows
- Live in `.claude/skills/` on `main`, immediately available to every user

**Feature skills** (in marketplace, installed on demand):
- `/add-discord`, `/add-telegram`, `/add-slack`, `/add-gmail`, etc.
- Each has a SKILL.md with setup instructions and a corresponding `skill/*` branch with code
- Live in the marketplace repo (`qwibitai/nanoclaw-skills`)

Users never interact with the marketplace directly. The operational skills `/setup` and `/customize` handle plugin installation transparently:

```bash
# Claude runs this behind the scenes — users don't see it
claude plugin install nanoclaw-skills@nanoclaw-skills --scope project
```

Skills are hot-loaded after `claude plugin install` — no restart needed. This means `/setup` can install the marketplace plugin, then immediately run any feature skill, all in one session.

### Selective skill installation

`/setup` asks users what channels they want, then only offers relevant skills:

1. "Which messaging channels do you want to use?" → Discord, Telegram, Slack, WhatsApp
2. User picks Telegram → Claude installs the plugin and runs `/add-telegram`
3. After Telegram is set up: "Want to add Agent Swarm support for Telegram?" → offers `/add-telegram-swarm`
4. "Want to enable community skills?" → installs community marketplace plugins

Dependent skills (e.g., `telegram-swarm` depends on `telegram`) are only offered after their parent is installed. `/customize` follows the same pattern for post-setup additions.

### Marketplace configuration

NanoClaw's `.claude/settings.json` registers the official marketplace:

```json
{
  "extraKnownMarketplaces": {
    "nanoclaw-skills": {
      "source": {
        "source": "github",
        "repo": "qwibitai/nanoclaw-skills"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The marketplace repo uses Claude Code's plugin structure:

```
qwibitai/nanoclaw-skills/
  .claude-plugin/
    marketplace.json              # Plugin catalog
  plugins/
    nanoclaw-skills/              # Single plugin bundling all official skills
      .claude-plugin/
        plugin.json               # Plugin manifest
      skills/
        add-discord/
          SKILL.md                # Setup instructions; step 1 is "merge the branch"
        add-telegram/
          SKILL.md
        add-slack/
          SKILL.md
        ...
```

Multiple skills are bundled in one plugin — installing `nanoclaw-skills` makes all feature skills available at once. Individual skills don't need separate installation.

Each SKILL.md tells Claude to merge the corresponding skill branch as step 1, then walks through interactive setup (env vars, bot creation, etc.).

### Applying a skill

User runs `/add-discord` (discovered via marketplace). Claude follows the SKILL.md:

1. `git fetch upstream skill/discord`
2. `git merge upstream/skill/discord`
3. Interactive setup (create bot, get token, configure env vars, etc.)

Or manually:

```bash
git fetch upstream skill/discord
git merge upstream/skill/discord
```

### Applying multiple skills

```bash
git merge upstream/skill/discord
git merge upstream/skill/telegram
```

Git handles the composition. If both skills modify the same lines, it's a real conflict and Claude resolves it.

### Updating core

```bash
git fetch upstream main
git merge upstream/main
```

Since skill branches are kept merged-forward with main (see CI section), the user's merged-in skill changes and upstream changes have proper common ancestors.

### Checking for skill updates

Users who previously merged a skill branch can check for updates. For each `upstream/skill/*` branch, check whether the branch has commits that aren't in the user's HEAD:

```bash
git fetch upstream
for branch in $(git branch -r | grep 'upstream/skill/'); do
  # Check if user has merged this skill at some point
  merge_base=$(git merge-base HEAD "$branch" 2>/dev/null) || continue
  # Check if the skill branch has new commits beyond what the user has
  if ! git merge-base --is-ancestor "$branch" HEAD 2>/dev/null; then
    echo "$branch has updates available"
  fi
done
```

This requires no state — it uses git history to determine which skills were previously merged and whether they have new commits.

This logic is available in two ways:
- Built into `/update-nanoclaw` — after merging main, optionally check for skill updates
- Standalone `/update-skills` — check and merge skill updates independently

### Conflict resolution

At any merge step, conflicts may arise. Claude resolves them — reading the conflicted files, understanding the intent of both sides, and producing the correct result. This is what makes the branch approach viable at scale: conflict resolution that previously required human judgment is now automated.

### Skill dependencies

Some skills depend on other skills. E.g., `skill/telegram-swarm` requires `skill/telegram`. Dependent skill branches are branched from their parent skill branch, not from `main`.

This means `skill/telegram-swarm` includes all of telegram's changes plus its own additions. When a user merges `skill/telegram-swarm`, they get both — no need to merge telegram separately.

Dependencies are implicit in git history — `git merge-base --is-ancestor` determines whether one skill branch is an ancestor of another. No separate dependency file is needed.

### Uninstalling a skill

```bash
# Find the merge commit
git log --merges --oneline | grep discord

# Revert it
git revert -m 1 <merge-commit>
```

This creates a new commit that undoes the skill's changes. Claude can handle the whole flow.

If the user has modified the skill's code since merging (custom changes on top), the revert might conflict — Claude resolves it.

If the user later wants to re-apply the skill, they need to revert the revert first (git treats reverted changes as "already applied and undone"). Claude handles this too.

## CI: Keeping Skill Branches Current

A GitHub Action runs on every push to `main`:

1. List all `skill/*` branches
2. For each skill branch, merge `main` into it (merge-forward, not rebase)
3. Run build and tests on the merged result
4. If tests pass, push the updated skill branch
5. If a skill fails (conflict, build error, test failure), open a GitHub issue for manual resolution

**Why merge-forward instead of rebase:**
- No force-push — preserves history for users who already merged the skill
- Users can re-merge a skill branch to pick up skill updates (bug fixes, improvements)
- Git has proper common ancestors throughout the merge graph

**Why this scales:** With a few hundred skills and a few commits to main per day, the CI cost is trivial. Haiku is fast and cheap. The approach that wouldn't have been feasible a year or two ago is now practical because Claude can resolve conflicts at scale.

## Installation Flow

### New users (recommended)

1. Fork `qwibitai/nanoclaw` on GitHub (click the Fork button)
2. Clone your fork:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<you>/nanoclaw.git
   cd nanoclaw
   ```
3. Run Claude Code:
   ```bash
   claude
   ```
4. Run `/setup` — Claude handles dependencies, authentication, container setup, service configuration, and adds `upstream` remote if not present

Forking is recommended because it gives users a remote to push their customizations to. Clone-only works for trying things out but provides no remote backup.

### Existing users migrating from clone

Users who previously ran `git clone https://github.com/qwibitai/nanoclaw.git` and have local customizations:

1. Fork `qwibitai/nanoclaw` on GitHub
2. Reroute remotes:
   ```bash
   git remote rename origin upstream
   git remote add origin https://github.com/<you>/nanoclaw.git
   git push --force origin main
   ```
   The `--force` is needed because the fresh fork's main is at upstream's latest, but the user wants their (possibly behind) version. The fork was just created so there's nothing to lose.
3. From this point, `origin` = their fork, `upstream` = qwibitai/nanoclaw

### Existing users migrating from the old skills engine

Users who previously applied skills via the `skills-engine/` system have skill code in their tree but no merge commits linking to skill branches. Git doesn't know these changes came from a skill, so merging a skill branch on top would conflict or duplicate.

**For new skills going forward:** just merge skill branches as normal. No issue.

**For existing old-engine skills**, two migration paths:

**Option A: Per-skill reapply (keep your fork)**
1. For each old-engine skill: identify and revert the old changes, then merge the skill branch fresh
2. Claude assists with identifying what to revert and resolving any conflicts
3. Custom modifications (non-skill changes) are preserved

**Option B: Fresh start (cleanest)**
1. Create a new fork from upstream
2. Merge the skill branches you want
3. Manually re-apply your custom (non-skill) changes
4. Claude assists by diffing your old fork against the new one to identify custom changes

In both cases:
- Delete the `.nanoclaw/` directory (no longer needed)
- The `skills-engine/` code will be removed from upstream once all skills are migrated
- `/update-skills` only tracks skills applied via branch merge — old-engine skills won't appear in update checks

## User Workflows

### Custom changes

Users make custom changes directly on their main branch. This is the standard fork workflow — their `main` IS their customized version.

```bash
# Make changes
vim src/config.ts
git commit -am "change trigger word to @Bob"
git push origin main
```

Custom changes, skills, and core updates all coexist on their main branch. Git handles the three-way merging at each merge step because it can trace common ancestors through the merge history.

### Applying a skill

Run `/add-discord` in Claude Code (discovered via the marketplace plugin), or manually:

```bash
git fetch upstream skill/discord
git merge upstream/skill/discord
# Follow setup instructions for configuration
git push origin main
```

If the user is behind upstream's main when they merge a skill branch, the merge might bring in some core changes too (since skill branches are merged-forward with main). This is generally fine — they get a compatible version of everything.

### Updating core

```bash
git fetch upstream main
git merge upstream/main
git push origin main
```

This is the same as the existing `/update-nanoclaw` skill's merge path.

### Updating skills

Run `/update-skills` or let `/update-nanoclaw` check after a core update. For each previously-merged skill branch that has new commits, Claude offers to merge the updates.

### Contributing back to upstream

Users who want to submit a PR to upstream:

```bash
git fetch upstream main
git checkout -b my-fix upstream/main
# Make changes
git push origin my-fix
# Create PR from my-fix to qwibitai/nanoclaw:main
```

Standard fork contribution workflow. Their custom changes stay on their main and don't leak into the PR.

## Contributing a Skill

The flow below is for **feature skills** (branch-based). For utility skills (self-contained tools) and container skills, the contributor opens a PR that adds files directly to `.claude/skills/<name>/` or `container/skills/<name>/` — no branch extraction needed. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](../bmad_repo/CONTRIBUTING.md) for all skill types.

### Contributor flow (feature skills)

1. Fork `qwibitai/nanoclaw`
2. Branch from `main`
3. Make the code changes (new channel file, modified integration points, updated package.json, .env.example additions, etc.)
4. Open a PR to `main`

The contributor opens a normal PR — they don't need to know about skill branches or marketplace repos. They just make code changes and submit.

### Maintainer flow

When a skill PR is reviewed and approved:

1. Create a `skill/<name>` branch from the PR's commits:
   ```bash
   git fetch origin pull/<PR_NUMBER>/head:skill/<name>
   git push origin skill/<name>
   ```
2. Force-push to the contributor's PR branch, replacing it with a single commit that adds the contributor to `CONTRIBUTORS.md` (removing all code changes)
3. Merge the slimmed PR into `main` (just the contributor addition)
4. Add the skill's SKILL.md to the marketplace repo (`qwibitai/nanoclaw-skills`)

This way:
- The contributor gets merge credit (their PR is merged)
- They're added to CONTRIBUTORS.md automatically by the maintainer
- The skill branch is created from their work
- `main` stays clean (no skill code)
- The contributor only had to do one thing: open a PR with code changes

**Note:** GitHub PRs from forks have "Allow edits from maintainers" checked by default, so the maintainer can push to the contributor's PR branch.

### Skill SKILL.md

The contributor can optionally provide a SKILL.md (either in the PR or separately). This goes into the marketplace repo and contains:

1. Frontmatter (name, description, triggers)
2. Step 1: Merge the skill branch
3. Steps 2-N: Interactive setup (create bot, get token, configure env vars, verify)

If the contributor doesn't provide a SKILL.md, the maintainer writes one based on the PR.

## Community Marketplaces

Anyone can maintain their own fork with skill branches and their own marketplace repo. This enables a community-driven skill ecosystem without requiring write access to the upstream repo.

### How it works

A community contributor:

1. Maintains a fork of NanoClaw (e.g., `alice/nanoclaw`)
2. Creates `skill/*` branches on their fork with their custom skills
3. Creates a marketplace repo (e.g., `alice/nanoclaw-skills`) with a `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` and plugin structure

### Adding a community marketplace

If the community contributor is trusted, they can open a PR to add their marketplace to NanoClaw's `.claude/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "extraKnownMarketplaces": {
    "nanoclaw-skills": {
      "source": {
        "source": "github",
        "repo": "qwibitai/nanoclaw-skills"
      }
    },
    "alice-nanoclaw-skills": {
      "source": {
        "source": "github",
        "repo": "alice/nanoclaw-skills"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Once merged, all NanoClaw users automatically discover the community marketplace alongside the official one.

### Installing community skills

`/setup` and `/customize` ask users whether they want to enable community skills. If yes, Claude installs community marketplace plugins via `claude plugin install`:

```bash
claude plugin install alice-skills@alice-nanoclaw-skills --scope project
```

Community skills are hot-loaded and immediately available — no restart needed. Dependent skills are only offered after their prerequisites are met (e.g., community Telegram add-ons only after Telegram is installed).

Users can also browse and install community plugins manually via `/plugin`.

### Properties of this system

- **No gatekeeping required.** Anyone can create skills on their fork without permission. They only need approval to be listed in the auto-discovered marketplaces.
- **Multiple marketplaces coexist.** Users see skills from all trusted marketplaces in `/plugin`.
- **Community skills use the same merge pattern.** The SKILL.md just points to a different remote:
  ```bash
  git remote add alice https://github.com/alice/nanoclaw.git
  git fetch alice skill/my-cool-feature
  git merge alice/skill/my-cool-feature
  ```
- **Users can also add marketplaces manually.** Even without being listed in settings.json, users can run `/plugin marketplace add alice/nanoclaw-skills` to discover skills from any source.
- **CI is per-fork.** Each community maintainer runs their own CI to keep their skill branches merged-forward. They can use the same GitHub Action as the upstream repo.

## Flavors

A flavor is a curated fork of NanoClaw — a combination of skills, custom changes, and configuration tailored for a specific use case (e.g., "NanoClaw for Sales," "NanoClaw Minimal," "NanoClaw for Developers").

### Creating a flavor

1. Fork `qwibitai/nanoclaw`
2. Merge in the skills you want
3. Make custom changes (trigger word, prompts, integrations, etc.)
4. Your fork's `main` IS the flavor

### Installing a flavor

During `/setup`, users are offered a choice of flavors before any configuration happens. The setup skill reads `flavors.yaml` from the repo (shipped with upstream, always up to date) and presents options:

AskUserQuestion: "Start with a flavor or default NanoClaw?"
- Default NanoClaw
- NanoClaw for Sales — Gmail + Slack + CRM (maintained by alice)
- NanoClaw Minimal — Telegram-only, lightweight (maintained by bob)

If a flavor is chosen:

```bash
git remote add <flavor-name> https://github.com/alice/nanoclaw.git
git fetch <flavor-name> main
git merge <flavor-name>/main
```

Then setup continues normally (dependencies, auth, container, service).

**This choice is only offered on a fresh fork** — when the user's main matches or is close to upstream's main with no local commits. If `/setup` detects significant local changes (re-running setup on an existing install), it skips the flavor selection and goes straight to configuration.

After installation, the user's fork has three remotes:
- `origin` — their fork (push customizations here)
- `upstream` — `qwibitai/nanoclaw` (core updates)
- `<flavor-name>` — the flavor fork (flavor updates)

### Updating a flavor

```bash
git fetch <flavor-name> main
git merge <flavor-name>/main
```

The flavor maintainer keeps their fork updated (merging upstream, updating skills). Users pull flavor updates the same way they pull core updates.

### Flavors registry

`flavors.yaml` lives in the upstream repo:

```yaml
flavors:
  - name: NanoClaw for Sales
    repo: alice/nanoclaw
    description: Gmail + Slack + CRM integration, daily pipeline summaries
    maintainer: alice

  - name: NanoClaw Minimal
    repo: bob/nanoclaw
    description: Telegram-only, no container overhead
    maintainer: bob
```

Anyone can PR to add their flavor. The file is available locally when `/setup` runs since it's part of the cloned repo.

### Discoverability

- **During setup** — flavor selection is offered as part of the initial setup flow
- **`/browse-flavors` skill** — reads `flavors.yaml` and presents options at any time
- **GitHub topics** — flavor forks can tag themselves with `nanoclaw-flavor` for searchability
- **Discord / website** — community-curated lists

## Migration

Migration from the old skills engine to branches is complete. All feature skills now live on `skill/*` branches, and the skills engine has been removed.

### Skill branches

| Branch | Base | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `skill/whatsapp` | `main` | WhatsApp channel |
| `skill/telegram` | `main` | Telegram channel |
| `skill/slack` | `main` | Slack channel |
| `skill/discord` | `main` | Discord channel |
| `skill/gmail` | `main` | Gmail channel |
| `skill/voice-transcription` | `skill/whatsapp` | OpenAI Whisper voice transcription |
| `skill/image-vision` | `skill/whatsapp` | Image attachment processing |
| `skill/pdf-reader` | `skill/whatsapp` | PDF attachment reading |
| `skill/local-whisper` | `skill/voice-transcription` | Local whisper.cpp transcription |
| `skill/ollama-tool` | `main` | Ollama MCP server for local models |
| `skill/apple-container` | `main` | Apple Container runtime |
| `skill/reactions` | `main` | WhatsApp emoji reactions |

### What was removed

- `skills-engine/` directory (entire engine)
- `scripts/apply-skill.ts`, `scripts/uninstall-skill.ts`, `scripts/rebase.ts`
- `scripts/fix-skill-drift.ts`, `scripts/validate-all-skills.ts`
- `.github/workflows/skill-drift.yml`, `.github/workflows/skill-pr.yml`
- All `add/`, `modify/`, `tests/`, and `manifest.yaml` from skill directories
- `.nanoclaw/` state directory

Operational skills (`setup`, `debug`, `update-nanoclaw`, `customize`, `update-skills`) remain on main in `.claude/skills/`.

## What Changes

### README Quick Start

Before:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/qwibitai/NanoClaw.git
cd NanoClaw
claude
```

After:
```
1. Fork qwibitai/nanoclaw on GitHub
2. git clone https://github.com/<you>/nanoclaw.git
3. cd nanoclaw
4. claude
5. /setup
```

### Setup skill (`/setup`)

Updates to the setup flow:

- Check if `upstream` remote exists; if not, add it: `git remote add upstream https://github.com/qwibitai/nanoclaw.git`
- Check if `origin` points to the user's fork (not qwibitai). If it points to qwibitai, guide them through the fork migration.
- **Install marketplace plugin:** `claude plugin install nanoclaw-skills@nanoclaw-skills --scope project` — makes all feature skills available (hot-loaded, no restart)
- **Ask which channels to add:** present channel options (Discord, Telegram, Slack, WhatsApp, Gmail), run corresponding `/add-*` skills for selected channels
- **Offer dependent skills:** after a channel is set up, offer relevant add-ons (e.g., Agent Swarm after Telegram, voice transcription after WhatsApp)
- **Optionally enable community marketplaces:** ask if the user wants community skills, install those marketplace plugins too

### `.claude/settings.json`

Marketplace configuration so the official marketplace is auto-registered:

```json
{
  "extraKnownMarketplaces": {
    "nanoclaw-skills": {
      "source": {
        "source": "github",
        "repo": "qwibitai/nanoclaw-skills"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Skills directory on main

The `.claude/skills/` directory on `main` retains only operational skills (setup, debug, update-nanoclaw, customize, update-skills). Feature skills (add-discord, add-telegram, etc.) live in the marketplace repo, installed via `claude plugin install` during `/setup` or `/customize`.

### Skills engine removal

The following can be removed:

- `skills-engine/` — entire directory (apply, merge, replay, state, backup, etc.)
- `scripts/apply-skill.ts`
- `scripts/uninstall-skill.ts`
- `scripts/fix-skill-drift.ts`
- `scripts/validate-all-skills.ts`
- `.nanoclaw/` — state directory
- `add/` and `modify/` subdirectories from all skill directories
- Feature skill SKILL.md files from `.claude/skills/` on main (they now live in the marketplace)

Operational skills (`setup`, `debug`, `update-nanoclaw`, `customize`, `update-skills`) remain on main in `.claude/skills/`.

### New infrastructure

- **Marketplace repo** (`qwibitai/nanoclaw-skills`) — single Claude Code plugin bundling SKILL.md files for all feature skills
- **CI GitHub Action** — merge-forward `main` into all `skill/*` branches on every push to `main`, using Claude (Haiku) for conflict resolution
- **`/update-skills` skill** — checks for and applies skill branch updates using git history
- **`CONTRIBUTORS.md`** — tracks skill contributors

### Update skill (`/update-nanoclaw`)

The update skill gets simpler with the branch-based approach. The old skills engine required replaying all applied skills after merging core updates — that entire step disappears. Skill changes are already in the user's git history, so `git merge upstream/main` just works.

**What stays the same:**
- Preflight (clean working tree, upstream remote)
- Backup branch + tag
- Preview (git log, git diff, file buckets)
- Merge/cherry-pick/rebase options
- Conflict preview (dry-run merge)
- Conflict resolution
- Build + test validation
- Rollback instructions

**What's removed:**
- Skill replay step (was needed by the old skills engine to re-apply skills after core update)
- Re-running structured operations (npm deps, env vars — these are part of git history now)

**What's added:**
- Optional step at the end: "Check for skill updates?" which runs the `/update-skills` logic
- This checks whether any previously-merged skill branches have new commits (bug fixes, improvements to the skill itself — not just merge-forwards from main)

**Why users don't need to re-merge skills after a core update:**
When the user merged a skill branch, those changes became part of their git history. When they later merge `upstream/main`, git performs a normal three-way merge — the skill changes in their tree are untouched, and only core changes are brought in. The merge-forward CI ensures skill branches stay compatible with latest main, but that's for new users applying the skill fresh. Existing users who already merged the skill don't need to do anything.

Users only need to re-merge a skill branch if the skill itself was updated (not just merged-forward with main). The `/update-skills` check detects this.

## Discord Announcement

### For existing users

> **Skills are now git branches**
>
> We've simplified how skills work in NanoClaw. Instead of a custom skills engine, skills are now git branches that you merge in.
>
> **What this means for you:**
> - Applying a skill: `git fetch upstream skill/discord && git merge upstream/skill/discord`
> - Updating core: `git fetch upstream main && git merge upstream/main`
> - Checking for skill updates: `/update-skills`
> - No more `.nanoclaw/` state directory or skills engine
>
> **We now recommend forking instead of cloning.** This gives you a remote to push your customizations to.
>
> **If you currently have a clone with local changes**, migrate to a fork:
> 1. Fork `qwibitai/nanoclaw` on GitHub
> 2. Run:
>    ```
>    git remote rename origin upstream
>    git remote add origin https://github.com/<you>/nanoclaw.git
>    git push --force origin main
>    ```
>    This works even if you're way behind — just push your current state.
>
> **If you previously applied skills via the old system**, your code changes are already in your working tree — nothing to redo. You can delete the `.nanoclaw/` directory. Future skills and updates use the branch-based approach.
>
> **Discovering skills:** Skills are now available through Claude Code's plugin marketplace. Run `/plugin` in Claude Code to browse and install available skills.

### For skill contributors

> **Contributing skills**
>
> To contribute a skill:
> 1. Fork `qwibitai/nanoclaw`
> 2. Branch from `main` and make your code changes
> 3. Open a regular PR
>
> That's it. We'll create a `skill/<name>` branch from your PR, add you to CONTRIBUTORS.md, and add the SKILL.md to the marketplace. CI automatically keeps skill branches merged-forward with `main` using Claude to resolve any conflicts.
>
> **Want to run your own skill marketplace?** Maintain skill branches on your fork and create a marketplace repo. Open a PR to add it to NanoClaw's auto-discovered marketplaces — or users can add it manually via `/plugin marketplace add`.

## Architecture: Channel System

The core ships with no channels built in — each channel (WhatsApp, Telegram, Slack, Discord, Gmail) is installed as a [Claude Code skill](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/skills) that adds the channel code to your fork. Channels self-register at startup; installed channels with missing credentials emit a WARN log and are skipped.

### System Diagram

### Channel Registry

The channel system is built on a factory registry in `src/channels/registry.ts`:

```typescript
export type ChannelFactory = (opts: ChannelOpts) => Channel | null;

const registry = new Map<string, ChannelFactory>();

export function registerChannel(name: string, factory: ChannelFactory): void {
  registry.set(name, factory);
}

export function getChannelFactory(name: string): ChannelFactory | undefined {
  return registry.get(name);
}

export function getRegisteredChannelNames(): string[] {
  return [...registry.keys()];
}
```

Each factory receives `ChannelOpts` (callbacks for `onMessage`, `onChatMetadata`, and `registeredGroups`) and returns either a `Channel` instance or `null` if that channel's credentials are not configured.

### Channel Interface

Every channel implements this interface (defined in `src/types.ts`):

```typescript
interface Channel {
  name: string;
  connect(): Promise<void>;
  sendMessage(jid: string, text: string): Promise<void>;
  isConnected(): boolean;
  ownsJid(jid: string): boolean;
  disconnect(): Promise<void>;
  setTyping?(jid: string, isTyping: boolean): Promise<void>;
  syncGroups?(force: boolean): Promise<void>;
}
```

### Self-Registration Pattern

Channels self-register using a barrel-import pattern:

1. Each channel skill adds a file to `src/channels/` (e.g. `whatsapp.ts`, `telegram.ts`) that calls `registerChannel()` at module load time:

   ```typescript
   // src/channels/whatsapp.ts
   import { registerChannel, ChannelOpts } from './registry.js';

   export class WhatsAppChannel implements Channel { /* ... */ }

   registerChannel('whatsapp', (opts: ChannelOpts) => {
     // Return null if credentials are missing
     if (!existsSync(authPath)) return null;
     return new WhatsAppChannel(opts);
   });
   ```

2. The barrel file `src/channels/index.ts` imports all channel modules, triggering registration:

   ```typescript
   import './whatsapp.js';
   import './telegram.js';
   // ... each skill adds its import here
   ```

3. At startup, the orchestrator (`src/index.ts`) loops through registered channels and connects whichever ones return a valid instance:

   ```typescript
   for (const name of getRegisteredChannelNames()) {
     const factory = getChannelFactory(name);
     const channel = factory?.(channelOpts);
     if (channel) {
       await channel.connect();
       channels.push(channel);
     }
   }
   ```

### Key Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `src/channels/registry.ts` | Channel factory registry |
| `src/channels/index.ts` | Barrel imports that trigger channel self-registration |
| `src/types.ts` | `Channel` interface, `ChannelOpts`, message types |
| `src/index.ts` | Orchestrator — instantiates channels, runs message loop |
| `src/router.ts` | Finds the owning channel for a JID, formats messages |

### Adding a New Channel

To add a new channel, contribute a skill to `.claude/skills/add-<name>/` that:

1. Adds a `src/channels/<name>.ts` file implementing the `Channel` interface
2. Calls `registerChannel(name, factory)` at module load
3. Returns `null` from the factory if credentials are missing
4. Adds an import line to `src/channels/index.ts`

See existing skills (`/add-whatsapp`, `/add-telegram`, `/add-slack`, `/add-discord`, `/add-gmail`) for the pattern.

## Configuration

Configuration constants are in `src/config.ts`:

```typescript
import path from 'path';

export const ASSISTANT_NAME = process.env.ASSISTANT_NAME || 'Andy';
export const POLL_INTERVAL = 2000;
export const SCHEDULER_POLL_INTERVAL = 60000;

// Paths are absolute (required for container mounts)
const PROJECT_ROOT = process.cwd();
export const STORE_DIR = path.resolve(PROJECT_ROOT, 'store');
export const GROUPS_DIR = path.resolve(PROJECT_ROOT, 'groups');
export const DATA_DIR = path.resolve(PROJECT_ROOT, 'data');

// Container configuration
export const CONTAINER_IMAGE = process.env.CONTAINER_IMAGE || 'nanoclaw-agent:latest';
export const CONTAINER_TIMEOUT = parseInt(process.env.CONTAINER_TIMEOUT || '1800000', 10); // 30min default
export const IPC_POLL_INTERVAL = 1000;
export const IDLE_TIMEOUT = parseInt(process.env.IDLE_TIMEOUT || '1800000', 10); // 30min — keep container alive after last result
export const MAX_CONCURRENT_CONTAINERS = Math.max(1, parseInt(process.env.MAX_CONCURRENT_CONTAINERS || '5', 10) || 5);

export const TRIGGER_PATTERN = new RegExp(`^@${ASSISTANT_NAME}\\b`, 'i');
```

**Note:** Paths must be absolute for container volume mounts to work correctly.

### Container Configuration

Groups can have additional directories mounted via `containerConfig` in the SQLite `registered_groups` table (stored as JSON in the `container_config` column). Example registration:

```typescript
setRegisteredGroup("1234567890@g.us", {
  name: "Dev Team",
  folder: "whatsapp_dev-team",
  trigger: "@Andy",
  added_at: new Date().toISOString(),
  containerConfig: {
    additionalMounts: [
      {
        hostPath: "~/projects/webapp",
        containerPath: "webapp",
        readonly: false,
      },
    ],
    timeout: 600000,
  },
});
```

Folder names follow the convention `{channel}_{group-name}` (e.g., `whatsapp_family-chat`, `telegram_dev-team`). The main group has `isMain: true` set during registration.

Additional mounts appear at `/workspace/extra/{containerPath}` inside the container.

**Mount syntax note:** Read-write mounts use `-v host:container`, but readonly mounts require `--mount "type=bind,source=...,target=...,readonly"` (the `:ro` suffix may not work on all runtimes).

### Claude Authentication

Configure authentication in a `.env` file in the project root. Two options:

**Option 1: Claude Subscription (OAuth token)**
```bash
CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN=sk-ant-oat01-...
```
The token can be extracted from `~/.claude/.credentials.json` if you're logged in to Claude Code.

**Option 2: Pay-per-use API Key**
```bash
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-api03-...
```

Only the authentication variables (`CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` and `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`) are extracted from `.env` and written to `data/env/env`, then mounted into the container at `/workspace/env-dir/env` and sourced by the entrypoint script. This ensures other environment variables in `.env` are not exposed to the agent. This workaround is needed because some container runtimes lose `-e` environment variables when using `-i` (interactive mode with piped stdin).

### Changing the Assistant Name

Set the `ASSISTANT_NAME` environment variable:

```bash
ASSISTANT_NAME=Bot npm start
```

Or edit the default in `src/config.ts`. This changes:
- The trigger pattern (messages must start with `@YourName`)
- The response prefix (`YourName:` added automatically)

### Placeholder Values in launchd

Files with `{{PLACEHOLDER}}` values need to be configured:
- `{{PROJECT_ROOT}}` - Absolute path to your nanoclaw installation
- `{{NODE_PATH}}` - Path to node binary (detected via `which node`)
- `{{HOME}}` - User's home directory

---

## Memory System

NanoClaw uses a hierarchical memory system based on CLAUDE.md files.

### Memory Hierarchy

| Level | Location | Read By | Written By | Purpose |
|-------|----------|---------|------------|---------|
| **Global** | `groups/CLAUDE.md` | All groups | Main only | Preferences, facts, context shared across all conversations |
| **Group** | `groups/{name}/CLAUDE.md` | That group | That group | Group-specific context, conversation memory |
| **Files** | `groups/{name}/*.md` | That group | That group | Notes, research, documents created during conversation |

### How Memory Works

1. **Agent Context Loading**
   - Agent runs with `cwd` set to `groups/{group-name}/`
   - Claude Agent SDK with `settingSources: ['project']` automatically loads:
     - `../CLAUDE.md` (parent directory = global memory)
     - `./CLAUDE.md` (current directory = group memory)

2. **Writing Memory**
   - When user says "remember this", agent writes to `./CLAUDE.md`
   - When user says "remember this globally" (main channel only), agent writes to `../CLAUDE.md`
   - Agent can create files like `notes.md`, `research.md` in the group folder

3. **Main Channel Privileges**
   - Only the "main" group (self-chat) can write to global memory
   - Main can manage registered groups and schedule tasks for any group
   - Main can configure additional directory mounts for any group
   - All groups have Bash access (safe because it runs inside container)

---

## Session Management

Sessions enable conversation continuity - Claude remembers what you talked about.

### How Sessions Work

1. Each group has a session ID stored in SQLite (`sessions` table, keyed by `group_folder`)
2. Session ID is passed to Claude Agent SDK's `resume` option
3. Claude continues the conversation with full context
4. Session transcripts are stored as JSONL files in `data/sessions/{group}/.claude/`

---

## Message Flow

### Incoming Message Flow

```
1. User sends a message via any connected channel
   │
   ▼
2. Channel receives message (e.g. Baileys for WhatsApp, Bot API for Telegram)
   │
   ▼
3. Message stored in SQLite (store/messages.db)
   │
   ▼
4. Message loop polls SQLite (every 2 seconds)
   │
   ▼
5. Router checks:
   ├── Is chat_jid in registered groups (SQLite)? → No: ignore
   └── Does message match trigger pattern? → No: store but don't process
   │
   ▼
6. Router catches up conversation:
   ├── Fetch all messages since last agent interaction
   ├── Format with timestamp and sender name
   └── Build prompt with full conversation context
   │
   ▼
7. Router invokes Claude Agent SDK:
   ├── cwd: groups/{group-name}/
   ├── prompt: conversation history + current message
   ├── resume: session_id (for continuity)
   └── mcpServers: nanoclaw (scheduler)
   │
   ▼
8. Claude processes message:
   ├── Reads CLAUDE.md files for context
   └── Uses tools as needed (search, email, etc.)
   │
   ▼
9. Router prefixes response with assistant name and sends via the owning channel
   │
   ▼
10. Router updates last agent timestamp and saves session ID
```

### Trigger Word Matching

Messages must start with the trigger pattern (default: `@Andy`):
- `@Andy what's the weather?` → ✅ Triggers Claude
- `@andy help me` → ✅ Triggers (case insensitive)
- `Hey @Andy` → ❌ Ignored (trigger not at start)
- `What's up?` → ❌ Ignored (no trigger)

### Conversation Catch-Up

When a triggered message arrives, the agent receives all messages since its last interaction in that chat. Each message is formatted with timestamp and sender name:

```
[Jan 31 2:32 PM] John: hey everyone, should we do pizza tonight?
[Jan 31 2:33 PM] Sarah: sounds good to me
[Jan 31 2:35 PM] John: @Andy what toppings do you recommend?
```

This allows the agent to understand the conversation context even if it wasn't mentioned in every message.

---

## Commands

### Commands Available in Any Group

| Command | Example | Effect |
|---------|---------|--------|
| `@Assistant [message]` | `@Andy what's the weather?` | Talk to Claude |

### Commands Available in Main Channel Only

| Command | Example | Effect |
|---------|---------|--------|
| `@Assistant add group "Name"` | `@Andy add group "Family Chat"` | Register a new group |
| `@Assistant remove group "Name"` | `@Andy remove group "Work Team"` | Unregister a group |
| `@Assistant list groups` | `@Andy list groups` | Show registered groups |
| `@Assistant remember [fact]` | `@Andy remember I prefer dark mode` | Add to global memory |

---

## Scheduled Tasks

NanoClaw has a built-in scheduler that runs tasks as full agents in their group's context.

### How Scheduling Works

1. **Group Context**: Tasks created in a group run with that group's working directory and memory
2. **Full Agent Capabilities**: Scheduled tasks have access to all tools (WebSearch, file operations, etc.)
3. **Optional Messaging**: Tasks can send messages to their group using the `send_message` tool, or complete silently
4. **Main Channel Privileges**: The main channel can schedule tasks for any group and view all tasks

### Schedule Types

| Type | Value Format | Example |
|------|--------------|---------|
| `cron` | Cron expression | `0 9 * * 1` (Mondays at 9am) |
| `interval` | Milliseconds | `3600000` (every hour) |
| `once` | ISO timestamp | `2024-12-25T09:00:00Z` |

### Creating a Task

```
User: @Andy remind me every Monday at 9am to review the weekly metrics

Claude: [calls mcp__nanoclaw__schedule_task]
        {
          "prompt": "Send a reminder to review weekly metrics. Be encouraging!",
          "schedule_type": "cron",
          "schedule_value": "0 9 * * 1"
        }

Claude: Done! I'll remind you every Monday at 9am.
```

### One-Time Tasks

```
User: @Andy at 5pm today, send me a summary of today's emails

Claude: [calls mcp__nanoclaw__schedule_task]
        {
          "prompt": "Search for today's emails, summarize the important ones, and send the summary to the group.",
          "schedule_type": "once",
          "schedule_value": "2024-01-31T17:00:00Z"
        }
```

### Managing Tasks

From any group:
- `@Andy list my scheduled tasks` - View tasks for this group
- `@Andy pause task [id]` - Pause a task
- `@Andy resume task [id]` - Resume a paused task
- `@Andy cancel task [id]` - Delete a task

From main channel:
- `@Andy list all tasks` - View tasks from all groups
- `@Andy schedule task for "Family Chat": [prompt]` - Schedule for another group

---

## MCP Servers

### NanoClaw MCP (built-in)

The `nanoclaw` MCP server is created dynamically per agent call with the current group's context.

**Available Tools:**
| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `schedule_task` | Schedule a recurring or one-time task |
| `list_tasks` | Show tasks (group's tasks, or all if main) |
| `get_task` | Get task details and run history |
| `update_task` | Modify task prompt or schedule |
| `pause_task` | Pause a task |
| `resume_task` | Resume a paused task |
| `cancel_task` | Delete a task |
| `send_message` | Send a message to the group via its channel |

---

## Deployment

NanoClaw runs as a single macOS launchd service.

### Startup Sequence

When NanoClaw starts, it:
1. **Ensures container runtime is running** - Automatically starts it if needed; kills orphaned NanoClaw containers from previous runs
2. Initializes the SQLite database (migrates from JSON files if they exist)
3. Loads state from SQLite (registered groups, sessions, router state)
4. **Connects channels** — loops through registered channels, instantiates those with credentials, calls `connect()` on each
5. Once at least one channel is connected:
   - Starts the scheduler loop
   - Starts the IPC watcher for container messages
   - Sets up the per-group queue with `processGroupMessages`
   - Recovers any unprocessed messages from before shutdown
   - Starts the message polling loop

## Security Considerations

### Container Isolation

All agents run inside containers (lightweight Linux VMs), providing:
- **Filesystem isolation**: Agents can only access mounted directories
- **Safe Bash access**: Commands run inside the container, not on your Mac
- **Network isolation**: Can be configured per-container if needed
- **Process isolation**: Container processes can't affect the host
- **Non-root user**: Container runs as unprivileged `node` user (uid 1000)

### Prompt Injection Risk

WhatsApp messages could contain malicious instructions attempting to manipulate Claude's behavior.

**Mitigations:**
- Container isolation limits blast radius
- Only registered groups are processed
- Trigger word required (reduces accidental processing)
- Agents can only access their group's mounted directories
- Main can configure additional directories per group
- Claude's built-in safety training

**Recommendations:**
- Only register trusted groups
- Review additional directory mounts carefully
- Review scheduled tasks periodically
- Monitor logs for unusual activity

### Credential Storage

| Credential | Storage Location | Notes |
|------------|------------------|-------|
| Claude CLI Auth | data/sessions/{group}/.claude/ | Per-group isolation, mounted to /home/node/.claude/ |
| WhatsApp Session | store/auth/ | Auto-created, persists ~20 days |

### File Permissions

The groups/ folder contains personal memory and should be protected:
```bash
chmod 700 groups/
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

| Issue | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| No response to messages | Service not running | Check `launchctl list | grep nanoclaw` |
| "Claude Code process exited with code 1" | Container runtime failed to start | Check logs; NanoClaw auto-starts container runtime but may fail |
| "Claude Code process exited with code 1" | Session mount path wrong | Ensure mount is to `/home/node/.claude/` not `/root/.claude/` |
| Session not continuing | Session ID not saved | Check SQLite: `sqlite3 store/messages.db "SELECT * FROM sessions"` |
| Session not continuing | Mount path mismatch | Container user is `node` with HOME=/home/node; sessions must be at `/home/node/.claude/` |
| "QR code expired" | WhatsApp session expired | Delete store/auth/ and restart |
| "No groups registered" | Haven't added groups | Use `@Andy add group "Name"` in main |

### Log Location

- `logs/nanoclaw.log` - stdout
- `logs/nanoclaw.error.log` - stderr

### Debug Mode

Run manually for verbose output:
```bash
npm run dev
# or
node dist/index.js
```
```

# Andy

You are Andy, a personal assistant. You help with tasks, answer questions, and can schedule reminders.

## What You Can Do

- Answer questions and have conversations
- Search the web and fetch content from URLs
- **Browse the web** with `agent-browser` — open pages, click, fill forms, take screenshots, extract data (run `agent-browser open <url>` to start, then `agent-browser snapshot -i` to see interactive elements)
- Read and write files in your workspace
- Run bash commands in your sandbox
- Schedule tasks to run later or on a recurring basis
- Send messages back to the chat

## Communication

Your output is sent to the user or group.

You also have `mcp__nanoclaw__send_message` which sends a message immediately while you're still working. This is useful when you want to acknowledge a request before starting longer work.

### Internal thoughts

If part of your output is internal reasoning rather than something for the user, wrap it in `<internal>` tags:

```
<internal>Compiled all three reports, ready to summarize.</internal>

Here are the key findings from the research...
```

Text inside `<internal>` tags is logged but not sent to the user. If you've already sent the key information via `send_message`, you can wrap the recap in `<internal>` to avoid sending it again.

### Sub-agents and teammates

When working as a sub-agent or teammate, only use `send_message` if instructed to by the main agent.

## Your Workspace

Files you create are saved in `/workspace/group/`. Use this for notes, research, or anything that should persist.

## Memory

The `conversations/` folder contains searchable history of past conversations. Use this to recall context from previous sessions.

When you learn something important:
- Create files for structured data (e.g., `customers.md`, `preferences.md`)
- Split files larger than 500 lines into folders
- Keep an index in your memory for the files you create

## Message Formatting

Format messages based on the channel you're responding to. Check your group folder name:

### Slack channels (folder starts with `slack_`)

Use Slack mrkdwn syntax. Run `/slack-formatting` for the full reference. Key rules:
- `*bold*` (single asterisks)
- `_italic_` (underscores)
- `<https://url|link text>` for links (NOT `[text](url)`)
- `•` bullets (no numbered lists)
- `:emoji:` shortcodes
- `>` for block quotes
- No `##` headings — use `*Bold text*` instead

### WhatsApp/Telegram channels (folder starts with `whatsapp_` or `telegram_`)

- `*bold*` (single asterisks, NEVER **double**)
- `_italic_` (underscores)
- `•` bullet points
- ` ``` ` code blocks

No `##` headings. No `[links](url)`. No `**double stars**`.

### Discord channels (folder starts with `discord_`)

Standard Markdown works: `**bold**`, `*italic*`, `[links](url)`, `# headings`.

---

## Task Scripts

For any recurring task, use `schedule_task`. Frequent agent invocations — especially multiple times a day — consume API credits and can risk account restrictions. If a simple check can determine whether action is needed, add a `script` — it runs first, and the agent is only called when the check passes. This keeps invocations to a minimum.

### How it works

1. You provide a bash `script` alongside the `prompt` when scheduling
2. When the task fires, the script runs first (30-second timeout)
3. Script prints JSON to stdout: `{ "wakeAgent": true/false, "data": {...} }`
4. If `wakeAgent: false` — nothing happens, task waits for next run
5. If `wakeAgent: true` — you wake up and receive the script's data + prompt

### Always test your script first

Before scheduling, run the script in your sandbox to verify it works:

```bash
bash -c 'node --input-type=module -e "
  const r = await fetch(\"https://api.github.com/repos/owner/repo/pulls?state=open\");
  const prs = await r.json();
  console.log(JSON.stringify({ wakeAgent: prs.length > 0, data: prs.slice(0, 5) }));
"'
```

### When NOT to use scripts

If a task requires your judgment every time (daily briefings, reminders, reports), skip the script — just use a regular prompt.

### Frequent task guidance

If a user wants tasks running more than ~2x daily and a script can't reduce agent wake-ups:

- Explain that each wake-up uses API credits and risks rate limits
- Suggest restructuring with a script that checks the condition first
- If the user needs an LLM to evaluate data, suggest using an API key with direct Anthropic API calls inside the script
- Help the user find the minimum viable frequency
```

## Admin Context

This is the **main channel**, which has elevated privileges.

## Authentication

Anthropic credentials must be either an API key from console.anthropic.com (`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`) or a long-lived OAuth token from `claude setup-token` (`CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN`). Short-lived tokens from the system keychain or `~/.claude/.credentials.json` expire within hours and can cause recurring container 401s. The `/setup` skill walks through this. OneCLI manages credentials (including Anthropic auth) — run `onecli --help`.

## Container Mounts

Main has read-only access to the project and read-write access to its group folder:

| Container Path | Host Path | Access |
|----------------|-----------|--------|
| `/workspace/project` | Project root | read-only |
| `/workspace/group` | `groups/main/` | read-write |

Key paths inside the container:
- `/workspace/project/store/messages.db` - SQLite database
- `/workspace/project/store/messages.db` (registered_groups table) - Group config
- `/workspace/project/groups/` - All group folders

---

## Managing Groups

### Finding Available Groups

Available groups are provided in `/workspace/ipc/available_groups.json`:

```json
{
  "groups": [
    {
      "jid": "120363336345536173@g.us",
      "name": "Family Chat",
      "lastActivity": "2026-01-31T12:00:00.000Z",
      "isRegistered": false
    }
  ],
  "lastSync": "2026-01-31T12:00:00.000Z"
}
```

Groups are ordered by most recent activity. The list is synced from WhatsApp daily.

If a group the user mentions isn't in the list, request a fresh sync:

```bash
echo '{"type": "refresh_groups"}' > /workspace/ipc/tasks/refresh_$(date +%s).json
```

Then wait a moment and re-read `available_groups.json`.

**Fallback**: Query the SQLite database directly:

```bash
sqlite3 /workspace/project/store/messages.db "
  SELECT jid, name, last_message_time
  FROM chats
  WHERE jid LIKE '%@g.us' AND jid != '__group_sync__'
  ORDER BY last_message_time DESC
  LIMIT 10;
"
```

### Registered Groups Config

Groups are registered in the SQLite `registered_groups` table:

```json
{
  "1234567890-1234567890@g.us": {
    "name": "Family Chat",
    "folder": "whatsapp_family-chat",
    "trigger": "@Andy",
    "added_at": "2024-01-31T12:00:00.000Z"
  }
}
```

Fields:
- **Key**: The chat JID (unique identifier — WhatsApp, Telegram, Slack, Discord, etc.)
- **name**: Display name for the group
- **folder**: Channel-prefixed folder name under `groups/` for this group's files and memory
- **trigger**: The trigger word (usually same as global, but could differ)
- **requiresTrigger**: Whether `@trigger` prefix is needed (default: `true`). Set to `false` for solo/personal chats where all messages should be processed
- **isMain**: Whether this is the main control group (elevated privileges, no trigger required)
- **added_at**: ISO timestamp when registered

### Trigger Behavior

- **Main group** (`isMain: true`): No trigger needed — all messages are processed automatically
- **Groups with `requiresTrigger: false`**: No trigger needed — all messages processed (use for 1-on-1 or solo chats)
- **Other groups** (default): Messages must start with `@AssistantName` to be processed

### Adding a Group

1. Query the database to find the group's JID
2. Use the `register_group` MCP tool with the JID, name, folder, and trigger
3. Optionally include `containerConfig` for additional mounts
4. The group folder is created automatically: `/workspace/project/groups/{folder-name}/`
5. Optionally create an initial `CLAUDE.md` for the group

Folder naming convention — channel prefix with underscore separator:
- WhatsApp "Family Chat" → `whatsapp_family-chat`
- Telegram "Dev Team" → `telegram_dev-team`
- Discord "General" → `discord_general`
- Slack "Engineering" → `slack_engineering`
- Use lowercase, hyphens for the group name part

#### Adding Additional Directories for a Group

Groups can have extra directories mounted. Add `containerConfig` to their entry:

```json
{
  "1234567890@g.us": {
    "name": "Dev Team",
    "folder": "dev-team",
    "trigger": "@Andy",
    "added_at": "2026-01-31T12:00:00Z",
    "containerConfig": {
      "additionalMounts": [
        {
          "hostPath": "~/projects/webapp",
          "containerPath": "webapp",
          "readonly": false
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

The directory will appear at `/workspace/extra/webapp` in that group's container.

#### Sender Allowlist

After registering a group, explain the sender allowlist feature to the user:

> This group can be configured with a sender allowlist to control who can interact with me. There are two modes:
>
> - **Trigger mode** (default): Everyone's messages are stored for context, but only allowed senders can trigger me with @{AssistantName}.
> - **Drop mode**: Messages from non-allowed senders are not stored at all.
>
> For closed groups with trusted members, I recommend setting up an allow-only list so only specific people can trigger me. Want me to configure that?

If the user wants to set up an allowlist, edit `~/.config/nanoclaw/sender-allowlist.json` on the host:

```json
{
  "default": { "allow": "*", "mode": "trigger" },
  "chats": {
    "<chat-jid>": {
      "allow": ["sender-id-1", "sender-id-2"],
      "mode": "trigger"
    }
  },
  "logDenied": true
}
```

Notes:
- Your own messages (`is_from_me`) explicitly bypass the allowlist in trigger checks. Bot messages are filtered out by the database query before trigger evaluation, so they never reach the allowlist.
- If the config file doesn't exist or is invalid, all senders are allowed (fail-open)
- The config file is on the host at `~/.config/nanoclaw/sender-allowlist.json`, not inside the container

### Removing a Group

1. Read `/workspace/project/data/registered_groups.json`
2. Remove the entry for that group
3. Write the updated JSON back
4. The group folder and its files remain (don't delete them)

### Listing Groups

Read `/workspace/project/data/registered_groups.json` and format it nicely.

---

## Global Memory

You can read and write to `/workspace/project/groups/global/CLAUDE.md` for facts that should apply to all groups. Only update global memory when explicitly asked to "remember this globally" or similar.

---

## Scheduling for Other Groups

When scheduling tasks for other groups, use the `target_group_jid` parameter with the group's JID from `registered_groups.json`:
- `schedule_task(prompt: "...", schedule_type: "cron", schedule_value: "0 9 * * 1", target_group_jid: "120363336345536173@g.us")`

The task will run in that group's context with access to their files and memory.

---

## Task Scripts

For any recurring task, use `schedule_task`. Frequent agent invocations — especially multiple times a day — consume API credits and can risk account restrictions. If a simple check can determine whether action is needed, add a `script` — it runs first, and the agent is only called when the check passes. This keeps invocations to a minimum.

4. If `wakeAgent: false` — nothing happens, task waits for next run
5. If `wakeAgent: true` — you wake up and receive the script's data + prompt

### Always test your script first

Before scheduling, run the script in your sandbox to verify it works:

```bash
bash -c 'node --input-type=module -e "
  const r = await fetch(\"https://api.github.com/repos/owner/repo/pulls?state=open\");
  const prs = await r.json();
  console.log(JSON.stringify({ wakeAgent: prs.length > 0, data: prs.slice(0, 5) }));
"'
```

# Repo Tokens

A GitHub Action that calculates the size of your codebase in terms of tokens and updates a badge in your README.

<p>
  <img src="examples/green.svg" alt="tokens 12.4k">&nbsp;
  <img src="examples/yellow-green.svg" alt="tokens 74.8k">&nbsp;
  <img src="examples/yellow.svg" alt="tokens 120k">&nbsp;
  <img src="examples/red.svg" alt="tokens 158k">
</p>

## Usage

```yaml
- uses: qwibitai/nanoclaw/repo-tokens@v1
  with:
    include: 'src/**/*.ts'
    exclude: 'src/**/*.test.ts'
```

This counts tokens using [tiktoken](https://github.com/openai/tiktoken) and writes the result between HTML comment markers in your README:

The badge color reflects what percentage of an LLMs context window the codebase fills (context window size is configurable, defaults to 200k which is the size of Claude Opus). Green for under 30%, yellow-green for 30%-50%, yellow for 50%-70%, red for 70%+.

## Why

Small codebases were always a good thing. With coding agents, there's now a huge advantage to having a codebase small enough that an agent can hold the full thing in context.

This badge gives some indication of how easy it will be to work with an agent on the codebase, and will hopefully be a visual reminder to avoid bloat.

## Examples

Repos using repo-tokens:

| Repo | Badge |
|------|-------|
| [NanoClaw](https://github.com/qwibitai/NanoClaw) | ![tokens](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/qwibitai/NanoClaw/main/repo-tokens/badge.svg) |

### Full workflow example

```yaml
name: Update token count

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
    paths: ['src/**']

permissions:
  contents: write

jobs:
  update-tokens:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - uses: actions/setup-python@v5
        with:
          python-version: '3.12'

      - uses: qwibitai/nanoclaw/repo-tokens@v1
        id: tokens
        with:
          include: 'src/**/*.ts'
          exclude: 'src/**/*.test.ts'
          badge-path: '.github/badges/tokens.svg'

      - name: Commit if changed
        run: |
          git add README.md .github/badges/tokens.svg
          git diff --cached --quiet && exit 0
          git config user.name "github-actions[bot]"
          git config user.email "github-actions[bot]@users.noreply.github.com"
          git commit -m "docs: update token count to ${{ steps.tokens.outputs.badge }}"
          git push
```

### README setup

Add markers where you want the token count text to appear:

```html
<!-- token-count --><!-- /token-count -->
```

The action replaces everything between the markers with the token count.

## Inputs

| Input | Default | Description |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| `include` | *required* | Glob patterns for files to count (space-separated) |
| `exclude` | `''` | Glob patterns to exclude (space-separated) |
| `context-window` | `200000` | Context window size for percentage calculation |
| `readme` | `README.md` | Path to README file |
| `encoding` | `cl100k_base` | Tiktoken encoding name |
| `marker` | `token-count` | HTML comment marker name |
| `badge-path` | `''` | Path to write SVG badge (empty = no SVG) |

## Outputs

| Output | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `tokens` | Total token count (e.g., `34940`) |
| `percentage` | Percentage of context window (e.g., `17`) |
| `badge` | The formatted text that was inserted (e.g., `34.9k tokens · 17% of context window`) |

## How it works

Composite GitHub Action. Installs tiktoken, runs ~60 lines of inline Python. Takes about 10 seconds.

The action counts tokens and updates the README but does not commit. Your workflow decides the git strategy.
