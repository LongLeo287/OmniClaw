## Why I Built NanoClaw

[OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw) is an impressive project, but I wouldn't have been able to sleep if I had given complex software I didn't understand full access to my life. OpenClaw has nearly half a million lines of code, 53 config files, and 70+ dependencies. Its security is at the application level (allowlists, pairing codes) rather than true OS-level isolation. Everything runs in one Node process with shared memory.

NanoClaw provides that same core functionality, but in a codebase small enough to understand: one process and a handful of files. Claude agents run in their own Linux containers with filesystem isolation, not merely behind permission checks.

## Quick Start

```bash
gh repo fork qwibitai/nanoclaw --clone
cd nanoclaw
claude
```

<details>
<summary>Without GitHub CLI</summary>

1. Fork [qwibitai/nanoclaw](https://github.com/qwibitai/nanoclaw) on GitHub (click the Fork button)
2. `git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/nanoclaw.git`
3. `cd nanoclaw`
4. `claude`

</details>

Then run `/setup`. Claude Code handles everything: dependencies, authentication, container setup and service configuration.

> **Note:** Commands prefixed with `/` (like `/setup`, `/add-whatsapp`) are [Claude Code skills](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/skills). Type them inside the `claude` CLI prompt, not in your regular terminal. If you don't have Claude Code installed, get it at [claude.com/product/claude-code](https://claude.com/product/claude-code).

## Philosophy

**Small enough to understand.** One process, a few source files and no microservices. If you want to understand the full NanoClaw codebase, just ask Claude Code to walk you through it.

**Secure by isolation.** Agents run in Linux containers (Apple Container on macOS, or Docker) and they can only see what's explicitly mounted. Bash access is safe because commands run inside the container, not on your host.

**Built for the individual user.** NanoClaw isn't a monolithic framework; it's software that fits each user's exact needs. Instead of becoming bloatware, NanoClaw is designed to be bespoke. You make your own fork and have Claude Code m
