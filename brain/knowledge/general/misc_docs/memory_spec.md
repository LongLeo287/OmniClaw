# MEMORY_SPEC.md â€” OmniClaw Memory Architecture

# Version: 2.0 | Updated: 2026-03-22

# Authority: Tier 4 (Data & Memory)

## Memory Layers Overview

OmniClaw utilizes **5 memory layers** with distinct retention, ownership, and access rules:

## What to Store (FACTS, not LOGS)

### Store:

- Recurring failure patterns ("X task always fails when Y context missing")
- Successful approaches ("GLM-5 works better for structured data tasks")
- Key decisions and their outcomes
- Cross-dept dependencies that kept blocking
- Learned performance baselines

### Do NOT Store:

- Raw conversation logs
- Full task receipts (those go in telemetry/)
- Transient session data (use daily/session)
- Token counts or timestamps of individual calls

---

## Memory Update Protocol

### Layer 1 â€” Knowledge Base (knowledge-ingest.md workflow)

New knowledge flows through `ops/workflows/knowledge-ingest.md` (7 phases).
Final destination: brain/knowledge/<domain>/
Nova (notebooklm-agent) is primary intake agent.

### Layer 2 â€” Global Memory (after CEO decision)

Write to `corp/memory/global/decisions_log.md`:

```markdown
## [DATE] â€” [DECISION TITLE]

Context: <what triggered the decision>
Options considered: A | B | C
Decision: <what was chosen>
Reasoning: <why>
Impact: <which depts / agents affected>
Review date: <when to evaluate outcome>
```

### Layer 3 â€” Dept Memory (after every brief cycle)

Manager writes to `corp/memory/departments/<dept>.md`:

```markdown
## Cycle N â€” [DATE RANGE]

Goals achieved: [list]
Goals missed: [list] â€” [root cause]
Patterns observed: [recurring facts]
Cross-dept dependencies: [what we needed from others]
Lessons learned: [actionable]
Next cycle focus: [top 3]
```

### Layer 4 â€” Agent Memory (after every task)

Write to `corp/memory/agents/<agent>.md`:

```markdown
## [DATE] â€” Task: <task-name>

Context: <1 sentence>
Outcome: SUCCESS | PARTIAL | FAILED
Key lesson: <1 sentence fact>
Next time: <what to do differently>
Current blockers: <any outstanding>
```

### Layer 5 â€” Daily Session (auto by archivist)

Archivist auto-creates `brain/memory/daily/<DATE>.md` at session start.
Schema: see brain/memory/daily/2026-03-22.md as reference.

---

## Memory Rotation (Archivist Role)

The `archivist` agent runs rotation on-demand (weekly or per CEO request):

```
1. Layer 5 (daily): Purge files > 7 days
2. Layer 4 (agents): Purge entries > 7 days, keep latest 3
3. Layer 3 (depts): Summarize entries > 30 days â†’ Layer 2 or Layer 1
4. Layer 2 (global): Never purge, compress > 1MB files
5. Layer 1 (knowledge): knowledge-curator-agent maintains index
6. Write rotation receipt to telemetry/
```

## Memory Access by Role

| Role                | Layer 1  | Layer 2 | Layer 3    | Layer 4     | Layer 5 |
| ------------------- | -------- | ------- | ---------- | ----------- | ------- |
| CEO                 | R/W      | R/W     | Read       | No          | Read    |
| C-Suite             | Read     | Read    | R/W (own)  | Read (dept) | Read    |
| Dept Head           | Read     | Read    | R/W (own)  | R/W (dept)  | Read    |
| Worker              | Read     | No      | Read (own) | R/W (own)   | No      |
| Nova                | R/W      | Read    | Read       | R/W (own)   | Read    |
| cognitive_reflector | Read all | R/W     | R/W all    | Read all    | Read    |
| archivist           | R/W      | R/W     | R/W        | R/W         | R/W     |
| knowledge-curator   | R/W      | Read    | Read       | No          | No      |
