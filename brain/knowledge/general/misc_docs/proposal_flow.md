## STANDARD PROPOSAL FLOW

```
STEP 1: CREATION (Agent â†’ Proposal file)
  Agent writes proposal to:
  brain/brain/memory/system_memory/proposals/PROP_<date>_<topic>.md
  Format required:
    ## PROPOSAL: <title>
    Owner: <agent>
    Date: <ISO date>
    Type: <KPI_CHANGE | NEW_SKILL | ROLE_CHANGE | STRATEGIC | NEW_DEPT>
    Priority: <HIGH | MEDIUM | LOW>

    ## Problem
    <what gap/issue triggered this>

    ## Proposed Solution
    <concrete change>

    ## Impact
    <expected outcome>

    ## Resources Required
    <cost, time, agents needed>

    ## Decision Required By
    <date or cycle>

STEP 2: NOTIFICATION (notification-bridge â†’ Telegram)
  notification-bridge sends:
  { priority: "HIGH", type: "CEO_PROPOSAL",
    title: "[PROP] <topic>",
    body: "<agent> submitted proposal â€” decisions needed" }

STEP 3: CEO REVIEW (Phase 1 of next cycle)
  CEO reads corp/proposals/ during BRIEF phase
  CEO adds decision to each file:
    ## CEO DECISION
    - Status: APPROVED | REJECTED | DEFERRED
    - Date: <date>
    - Notes: <rationale>

STEP 4: EXECUTION (if APPROVED)
  CEO types: "execute PROP_<date>_<topic>"
  Antigravity reads proposal â†’ routes to owning agent
  Agent executes â†’ writes receipt to telemetry/receipts/
  Updates: corp/memory/global/decisions_log.md

STEP 5: ARCHIVE
  Completed proposals â†’ corp/proposals/archive/DONE_<date>_<topic>.md
  Register in: corp/memory/global/decisions_log.md
```
