# The awesome manifesto

If you want your list to be included in `awesome`, try to only include actual awesome stuff in your list. After all, it's a curation, not a collection.

But **what is awesome?**

## Only awesome is awesome

Research if the stuff you're including is actually awesome. Only put stuff on the list that you or another contributor can personally recommend. You should rather leave stuff out than include too much.

## Awesome badge

This badge is for Awesome lists.

[![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)
[![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge-flat.svg)](https://awesome.re)
[![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge-flat2.svg)](https://awesome.re)

Add an awesome badge to the top of your list, right next to the title. [Example](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome-nodejs). You can choose either the regular badge or the flat one.

```md
[![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)
[![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge-flat.svg)](https://awesome.re)
[![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge-flat2.svg)](https://awesome.re)
```

You are allowed to use the badge on lists not included here and also on private lists.

*The badges should not be modified in any way.*

## Awesome mentioned badge

This badge is intended for projects featured in an Awesome list (**not for Awesome lists themselves**). For example, the [Chalk](https://github.com/chalk/chalk) project could feature this badge because it's listed in [Awesome Node.js](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome-nodejs). It's totally optional for projects, but it's a nice way to show they've been featured in an Awesome list. You can choose either the regular badge or the flat one.

[![Mentioned in Awesome](https://awesome.re/mentioned-badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)
[![Mentioned in Awesome](https://awesome.re/mentioned-badge-flat.svg)](https://awesome.re)

**Fill in the placeholders (Name and URL):**

```md
[![Mentioned in Awesome <INSERT LIST NAME>](https://awesome.re/mentioned-badge.svg)](https://github.com/<INSERT LIST URL>)
[![Mentioned in Awesome <INSERT LIST NAME>](https://awesome.re/mentioned-badge-flat.svg)](https://github.com/<INSERT LIST URL>)
```

Example:

```md
[![Mentioned in Awesome Node.js](https://awesome.re/mentioned-badge.svg)](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome-nodejs)
```

If you're an Awesome list maintainer, you could encourage projects in your list to add the badge.

*The badges should not be modified in any way.*

## Comment on why something is awesome

Apart from suggesting a particular item on your list, you should also inform your readers *why* it's on the list and how they will benefit from it.

## Make it clear what the list is about

Have a succinct description at the top of your readme. Make sure your list covers a certain scope and nothing else. Link to other awesome lists if you think they already cover a certain subject well enough.

## Pay attention to grammar

Ensure your list is grammatically correct, typo-free and has no Markdown formatting errors. This should also apply to pull requests.

## Choose an appropriate license

Keep in mind that if you [haven't selected a license](https://choosealicense.com/no-license/), it basically means the people are *not* allowed to reproduce, distribute or create derivative works.

[Creative Commons licenses](https://creativecommons.org/) are perfect for this purpose. **We would recommend [`CC0`](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).** Code licenses like MIT, BSD, GPL, and so forth are not recommended.

## Include contribution guidelines

People who are contributing to your list should have a clear understanding of how they should do so.

If you don't feel like writing one from scratch, feel free to take our [contributing.md](contributing.md) and modify it to your own needs.

## Stylize your list properly

Create a [table of contents](https://github.com/sindresorhus/stuff/blob/main/toc-generators.md), organize the content into different categories, and use images if suitable. Ensure all entries are consistent (e.g. all entry descriptions end in a `.`).

## Accept other people's opinion

If you're an owner of the list, respect other people's opinions. If there are plenty of users not agreeing with your decision, give it a second thought.

# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as
contributors and maintainers pledge to making participation in our project and
our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience,
nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and
orientation.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment
include:

* Using welcoming and inclusive language
* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
* Focusing on what is best for the community
* Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or
advances
* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as physical or electronic
  address, without explicit permission
* Other conduct that could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable
behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or
reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions
that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or
permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate,
threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces
when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of
representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail
address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be
further defined and clarified by project maintainers.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported by contacting the project team at sindresorhus@gmail.com. All
complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that
is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is
obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident.
Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good
faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other
members of the project's leadership.

## Attribution

This Code of Conduct is adapted from the [Contributor Covenant][homepage], version 1.4,
available at [https://contributor-covenant.org/version/1/4][version]

# Contribution Guidelines

Please note that this project is released with a [Contributor Code of Conduct](../../../vault/archives/archive_legacy/AutoGPT/docs/content/code-of-conduct.md). By participating in this project you agree to abide by its terms.

## Adding an awesome list

Please ensure your pull request adheres to the [list of guidelines](pull_request_template.md).

## Creating your own awesome list

To create your own list, check out the [instructions](../../../vault/archives/archive_legacy/awesome/create-list.md).

## Adding something to an awesome list

If you have something awesome to contribute to an awesome list, this is how you do it.

You will need a [GitHub account](https://github.com/join)! If you are new to GitHub, [get started here](https://github.com/firstcontributions/first-contributions).

1. Access the awesome list's GitHub page. For example: https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome
2. Click on the `readme.md` file: ![Step 2 Click on Readme.md](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/170270/9402920/53a7e3ea-480c-11e5-9d81-aecf64be55eb.png)
3. Now click on the edit icon. ![Step 3 - Click on Edit](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/170270/9402927/6506af22-480c-11e5-8c18-7ea823530099.png)
4. You can start editing the text of the file in the in-browser editor. Make sure you follow the guidelines above. You can use [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown/). ![Step 4 - Edit the file](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/170270/9402932/7301c3a0-480c-11e5-81f5-7e343b71674f.png)
5. Say why you're proposing the changes, and then click on "Propose file change". ![Step 5 - Propose Changes](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/170270/9402937/7dd0652a-480c-11e5-9138-bd14244593d5.png)
6. Submit the [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/)!

## Updating your Pull Request

Sometimes, a maintainer of an awesome list will ask you to edit your Pull Request before it is included. This is normally due to spelling errors or because your PR didn't match the awesome-* list guidelines.

[Here](https://github.com/RichardLitt/knowledge/blob/master/github/amending-a-commit-guide.md) is a write up on how to change a Pull Request and the different ways you can do that.
```

## File: `create-list.md`
```markdown
# Creating Your Own List

- Read the [Awesome manifesto](../../../vault/archives/archive_legacy/awesome/awesome.md) and [list guidelines](pull_request_template.md) and ensure your list complies.
- Search this list before making a new one, as yours may be a duplicate. If it is, try and contribute to the best one instead of making your own.
- You might find [this Yeoman generator](https://github.com/dar5hak/generator-awesome-list) useful.
- **Wait at least 30 days after creating a list before submitting it, to give it a chance to mature.**
- **Make sure you read the [list guidelines](pull_request_template.md) again before submitting a pull request for your list to be added here.**

Thanks for being awesome! 😎

## File: `license`
```
CC0 1.0 Universal

Statement of Purpose

The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer exclusive Copyright and Related Rights (defined below) upon the creator and subsequent owner(s) (each and all, an "owner") of an original work of authorship and/or a database (each, a "Work").

Certain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights to a Work for the purpose of contributing to a commons of creative, cultural and scientific works ("Commons") that the public can reliably and without fear of later claims of infringement build upon, modify, incorporate in other works, reuse and redistribute as freely as possible in any form whatsoever and for any purposes, including without limitation commercial purposes. These owners may contribute to the Commons to promote the ideal of a free culture and the further production of creative, cultural and scientific works, or to gain reputation or greater distribution for their Work in part through the use and efforts of others.

For these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any expectation of additional consideration or compensation, the person associating CC0 with a Work (the "Affirmer"), to the extent that he or she is an owner of Copyright and Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily elects to apply CC0 to the Work and publicly distribute the Work under its terms, with knowledge of his or her Copyright and Related Rights in the Work and the meaning and intended legal effect of CC0 on those rights.

Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights ("Copyright and Related Rights"). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not limited to, the following:
i. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display, communicate, and translate a Work;

ii. moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);

iii. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person's image or likeness depicted in a Work;

iv. rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work, subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(a), below;

v. rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data in a Work;

vi. database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases, and under any national implementation thereof, including any amended or successor version of such directive); and

vii. other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the world based on applicable law or treaty, and any national implementations thereof.

Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention of, applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently, irrevocably and unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights and associated claims and causes of action, whether now known or unknown (including existing as well as future claims and causes of action), in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the "Waiver"). Affirmer makes the Waiver for the benefit of each member of the public at large and to the detriment of Affirmer's heirs and successors, fully intending that such Waiver shall not be subject to revocation, rescission, cancellation, termination, or any other legal or equitable action to disrupt the quiet enjoyment of the Work by the public as contemplated by Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.

Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the Waiver shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into account Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the extent the Waiver is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected person a royalty-free, non transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive, irrevocable and unconditional license to exercise Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the "License"). The License shall be deemed effective as of the date CC0 was applied by Affirmer to the Work. Should any part of the License for any reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, such partial invalidity or ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder of the License, and in such case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or she will not (i) exercise any of his or her remaining Copyright and Related Rights in the Work or (ii) assert any associated claims and causes of action with respect to the Work, in either case contrary to Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.

Limitations and Disclaimers.

a. No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived, abandoned, surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this document.

b. Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or warranties of any kind concerning the Work, express, implied, statutory or otherwise, including without limitation warranties of title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non infringement, or the absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the present or absence of errors, whether or not discoverable, all to the greatest extent permissible under applicable law.

c. Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other persons that may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including without limitation any person's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work. Further, Affirmer disclaims responsibility for obtaining any necessary consents, permissions or other rights required for any use of the Work.

d. Affirmer understands and acknowledges that Creative Commons is not a party to this document and has no duty or obligation with respect to this CC0 or use of the Work.

### By submitting this pull request I confirm I've read and complied with the below requirements 🖖

**Please read it multiple times. I spent a lot of time on these guidelines and most people miss a lot.**

## Requirements for your pull request

- [ ] Fully AI-generated pull requests are not accepted.
- [ ] Don't open a Draft / WIP pull request while you work on the guidelines. A pull request should be 100% ready and should adhere to all the guidelines when you open it. **Instead use [#2242](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome/issues/2242) for incubation visibility**.

	Try to prioritize unreviewed PRs, but you can also add more comments to reviewed PRs. Go through the below list when reviewing. This requirement is meant to help make the Awesome project self-sustaining. Comment here which PRs you reviewed. You're expected to put a good effort into this and to be thorough. Look at previous PR reviews for inspiration. **Just commenting “looks good” or simply marking the pull request as approved does not count!** You have to actually point out mistakes or improvement suggestions.

- [ ] No blockchain-related lists.
- [ ] The suggested Awesome list complies with the below requirements.

- [ ] Is not AI-generated.
- [ ] Run [`awesome-lint`](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome-lint) on your list and fix the reported issues. If there are false-positives or things that cannot/shouldn't be fixed, please [report it](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome-lint/issues/new).
- [ ] The default branch should be named [`main`, not `master`](https://www.zdnet.com/article/github-to-replace-master-with-alternative-term-to-avoid-slavery-references/).

- [ ] Not a duplicate. Please search for existing submissions.
- [ ] Only has awesome items. Awesome lists are curations of the best, not everything.
- [ ] Does not contain items that are unmaintained, has archived repo, deprecated, or missing docs. If you really need to include such items, they should be in a separate Markdown file.
- [ ] Includes a project logo/illustration whenever possible.
	- Either centered, fullwidth, or placed at the top-right of the readme. [(Example)](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome-electron)
	- The image should link to the project website or any relevant website.
	- **The image should be high-DPI.** Set it to a maximum of half the width of the original image.
	- Don't include both a title saying `Awesome X` and a logo with `Awesome X`. You can put the header image in a `#` (Markdown header) or `<h1>`.
- [ ] Entries have a description, unless the title is descriptive enough by itself. It rarely is though.
- [ ] Includes the [Awesome badge](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome/blob/main/awesome.md#awesome-badge).
	- Should be placed on the right side of the readme heading.
		- Can be placed centered if the list has a centered graphics header.
	- Should link back to this list.
- [ ] Has a Table of Contents section.
	- Should be named `Contents`, not `Table of Contents`.
	- Should be the first section in the list.
	- Should only have one level of [nested lists](https://commonmark.org/help/tutorial/10-nestedLists.html), preferably none.
	- Must not feature `Contributing` or `Footnotes` sections.
- [ ] Has an appropriate license.
	- **We strongly recommend the [CC0 license](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/), but any [Creative Commons license](https://creativecommons.org/choose/) will work.**
		- Tip: You can quickly add it to your repo by going to this URL: `https://github.com/<user>/<repo>/community/license/new?branch=main&template=cc0-1.0` (replace `<user>` and `<repo>` accordingly).
	- A code license like MIT, BSD, Apache, GPL, etc, is not acceptable. Neither are WTFPL and [Unlicense](https://unlicense.org).
	- Place a file named `license` or `LICENSE` in the repo root with the license text.
	- **Do not** add the license name, text, or a `Licence` section to the readme. GitHub already shows the license name and link to the full text at the top of the repo.
	- To verify that you've read all the guidelines, please comment on your pull request with just the word `unicorn`.
- [ ] Has [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome/blob/main/awesome.md#include-contribution-guidelines).
	- The file should be named `contributing.md`. The casing is up to you.
	- It can optionally be linked from the readme in a dedicated section titled `Contributing`, positioned at the top or bottom of the main content.
	- The section should not appear in the Table of Contents.
- [ ] All non-important but necessary content (like extra copyright notices, hyperlinks to sources, pointers to expansive content, etc) should be grouped in a `Footnotes` section at the bottom of the readme. The section should not be present in the Table of Contents.
- [ ] Has consistent formatting and proper spelling/grammar.
	- The link and description are separated by a dash. <br>Example: `- [AVA](…) - JavaScript test runner.`
	- The description starts with an uppercase character and ends with a period.
	- Consistent and correct naming. For example, `Node.js`, not `NodeJS` or `node.js`.
- [ ] Does not use [hard-wrapping](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/319925/difference-between-hard-wrap-and-soft-wrap).
- [ ] Does not include a CI (e.g. GitHub Actions) badge.<br>You can still use a CI for linting, but the badge has no value in the readme.
- [ ] Does not include an `Inspired by awesome-foo` or `Inspired by the Awesome project` kinda link at the top of the readme. The Awesome badge is enough.

**Go to the top and read it again.**
