A reusable template for reverse-engineering any website into a clean, modern Next.js codebase using AI coding agents. 

**Recommended: [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) with Opus 4.6 for best results** — but works with a variety of AI coding agents.

Point it at a URL, run `/clone-website`, and your AI agent will inspect the site, extract design tokens and assets, write component specs, and dispatch parallel builders to reconstruct every section.

## Demo

> Click the image above to watch the full demo on YouTube.

## Quick Start

1. **Clone this repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/JCodesMore/ai-website-cloner-template.git my-clone
   cd my-clone
   ```
2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. **Start your AI agent** — Claude Code recommended:
   ```bash
   claude --chrome
   ```
4. **Run the skill**:
   ```
   /clone-website <target-url1> [<target-url2> ...]
   ```
5. **Customize** (optional) — after the base clone is built, modify as needed

> Using a different agent? Open `AGENTS.md` for project instructions — most agents pick it up automatically.

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) 24+
- An AI coding agent (see [Supported Platforms](#supported-platforms))

## Tech Stack

- **Next.js 16** — App Router, React 19, TypeScript strict
- **shadcn/ui** — Radix primitives + Tailwind CSS v4
- **Tailwind CSS v4** — oklch design tokens
- **Lucide React** — default icons (replaced by extracted SVGs during cloning)

## How It Works

The `/clone-website` skill runs a multi-phase pipeline:

1. **Reconnaissance** — screenshots, design token extraction, interaction sweep (scroll, click, hover, responsive)
2. **Foundation** — updates fonts, colors, globals, downloads all assets
3. **Component Specs** — writes detailed spec files (`docs/research/components/`) with exact computed CSS values, states, behaviors, and content
4. **Parallel Build** — dispatches builder agents in git worktrees, one per section/component
5. **Assembly & QA** — merges worktrees, wires up the page, runs visual diff against the original

Each builder agent receives the full component specification inline — exact `getComputedStyle()` values, interaction models, multi-state content, responsive breakpoints, and asset paths. No guessing.

## Use Cases

- **Platform migration** — rebuild a site you own from WordPress/Webflow/Squarespace into a modern Next.js codebase
- **Lost source code** — your site is live but the repo is gone, the developer left, or the stack is legacy. Get the code back in a modern format
- **Learning** — deconstruct how production sites achieve specific layouts, animations, and responsive behavior by working with real code

## Not Intended For

- **Phishing or impersonation** — this project must not be used for deceptive purposes, impersonation, or any activity that breaks the law.
- **Passing off someone's design as your own** — logos, brand assets, and original copy belong to their owners.
- **Violating terms of service** — some sites explicitly prohibit scraping or reproduction. Check first.

## Updating for Other Platforms

Two source-of-truth files power all platform support. Edit the source, then run the sync script:

| What                   | Source of truth                         | Sync command                       |

| Project instructions   | `AGENTS.md`                             | `bash scripts/sync-agent-rules.sh` |
| `/clone-website` skill | `.claude/skills/clone-website/SKILL.md` | `node scripts/sync-skills.mjs`     |

Each script regenerates the platform-specific copies automatically. Agents that read the source files natively need no regeneration.

# Website Reverse-Engineer Template

## What This Is
A reusable template for reverse-engineering any website into a clean, modern Next.js codebase using AI coding agents. The Next.js + shadcn/ui + Tailwind v4 base is pre-scaffolded — just run `/clone-website <url1> [<url2> ...]`.

## Tech Stack
- **Framework:** Next.js 16 (App Router, React 19, TypeScript strict)
- **UI:** shadcn/ui (Radix primitives, Tailwind CSS v4, `cn()` utility)
- **Icons:** Lucide React (default — will be replaced/supplemented by extracted SVGs)
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS v4 with oklch design tokens
- **Deployment:** Vercel

## Commands
- `npm run dev` — Start dev server
- `npm run build` — Production build
- `npm run lint` — ESLint check
- `npm run typecheck` — TypeScript check
- `npm run check` — Run lint + typecheck + build

## Code Style
- TypeScript strict mode, no `any`
- Named exports, PascalCase components, camelCase utils
- Tailwind utility classes, no inline styles
- 2-space indentation
- Responsive: mobile-first

## Design Principles
- **Pixel-perfect emulation** — match the target's spacing, colors, typography exactly
- **No personal aesthetic changes during emulation phase** — match 1:1 first, customize later
- **Real content** — use actual text and assets from the target site, not placeholders
- **Beauty-first** — every pixel matters

## Project Structure
```

  app/              # Next.js routes
  components/       # React components
    ui/             # shadcn/ui primitives
    icons.tsx       # Extracted SVG icons as React components
  lib/
    utils.ts        # cn() utility (shadcn)

```

## MOST IMPORTANT NOTES
- When launching Claude Code agent teams, ALWAYS have each teammate work in their own worktree branch and merge everyone's work at the end, resolving any merge conflicts smartly since you are basically serving the orchestrator role and have full context to our goals, work given, work achieved, and desired outcomes.
- After editing `AGENTS.md`, run `bash scripts/sync-agent-rules.sh` to regenerate platform-specific instruction files.
- After editing `.claude/skills/clone-website/SKILL.md`, run `node scripts/sync-skills.mjs` to regenerate the skill for all platforms.

# Website Inspection Guide

## How to Reverse-Engineer Any Website

This guide outlines what to capture when inspecting a target website via Chrome MCP or browser DevTools.

## Phase 1: Visual Audit

### Screenshots to Capture
- [ ] Every distinct page — desktop, tablet, mobile
- [ ] Dark mode variants (if applicable)
- [ ] Light mode variants (if applicable)
- [ ] Key interaction states (hover, active, open menus, modals)
- [ ] Loading/skeleton states
- [ ] Empty states
- [ ] Error states

### Design Tokens to Extract
- [ ] **Colors** — background, text (primary/secondary/muted), accent, border, hover, error, success, warning
- [ ] **Typography** — font family, sizes (h1-h6, body, caption, label), weights, line heights, letter spacing
- [ ] **Spacing** — padding/margin patterns (look for a scale: 4px, 8px, 12px, 16px, 24px, 32px, etc.)
- [ ] **Border radius** — buttons, cards, avatars, inputs
- [ ] **Shadows/elevation** — card shadows, dropdown shadows, modal overlay
- [ ] **Breakpoints** — when does the layout shift? (inspect with DevTools responsive mode)
- [ ] **Icons** — which icon library? custom SVGs? sizes?
- [ ] **Avatars** — sizes, shapes, fallback behavior
- [ ] **Buttons** — all variants (primary, secondary, ghost, icon-only, danger)
- [ ] **Inputs** — text fields, textareas, selects, checkboxes, toggles

## Phase 2: Component Inventory

For each distinct UI component, document:
1. **Name** — what would you call this component?
2. **Structure** — what HTML elements / child components does it contain?
3. **Variants** — does it have different sizes, colors, or states?
4. **States** — default, hover, active, disabled, loading, error, empty
5. **Responsive behavior** — how does it change at different breakpoints?
6. **Interactions** — click, hover, focus, keyboard navigation
7. **Animations** — transitions, entrance/exit animations, micro-interactions

### Common Components to Look For
- Navigation (top bar, sidebar, bottom bar)
- Cards / list items
- Buttons and links
- Forms and inputs
- Modals and dialogs
- Dropdowns and menus
- Tabs and segmented controls
- Avatars and user badges
- Loading skeletons
- Toast notifications
- Tooltips and popovers

## Phase 3: Layout Architecture

- [ ] **Grid system** — CSS Grid? Flexbox? Fixed widths?
- [ ] **Column layout** — how many columns at each breakpoint?
- [ ] **Max-width** — main content area max-width
- [ ] **Sticky elements** — header, sidebar, floating buttons
- [ ] **Z-index layers** — navigation, modals, tooltips, overlays
- [ ] **Scroll behavior** — infinite scroll, pagination, virtual scrolling

## Phase 4: Technical Stack Analysis

- [ ] **Framework** — React? Vue? Angular? Check `__NEXT_DATA__`, `__NUXT__`, `ng-version`
- [ ] **CSS approach** — Tailwind (utility classes), CSS Modules, Styled Components, Emotion, vanilla CSS
- [ ] **State management** — Redux (check DevTools), React Query, Zustand, Pinia
- [ ] **API patterns** — REST, GraphQL (check network tab for `/graphql` requests)
- [ ] **Font loading** — Google Fonts, self-hosted, system fonts
- [ ] **Image strategy** — CDN, lazy loading, srcset, WebP/AVIF
- [ ] **Animation library** — Framer Motion, GSAP, CSS transitions only

## Phase 5: Documentation Output

After inspection, create these files in `docs/research/`:
1. `DESIGN_TOKENS.md` — All extracted colors, typography, spacing
2. `COMPONENT_INVENTORY.md` — Every component with structure notes
3. `LAYOUT_ARCHITECTURE.md` — Page layouts, grid system, responsive behavior
4. `INTERACTION_PATTERNS.md` — Animations, transitions, hover states
5. `TECH_STACK_ANALYSIS.md` — What the site uses and our chosen equivalents

# Clone Website

You are about to reverse-engineer and rebuild **$ARGUMENTS** as pixel-perfect clones.

When multiple URLs are provided, process them independently and in parallel where possible, while keeping each site's extraction artifacts isolated in dedicated folders (for example, `docs/research/<hostname>/`).

This is not a two-phase process (inspect then build). You are a **foreman walking the job site** — as you inspect each section of the page, you write a detailed specification to a file, then hand that file to a specialist builder agent with everything they need. Extraction and construction happen in parallel, but extraction is meticulous and produces auditable artifacts.

## Scope Defaults

The target is whatever page `$ARGUMENTS` resolves to. Clone exactly what's visible at that URL. Unless the user specifies otherwise, use these defaults:

- **Fidelity level:** Pixel-perfect — exact match in colors, spacing, typography, animations
- **In scope:** Visual layout and styling, component structure and interactions, responsive design, mock data for demo purposes
- **Out of scope:** Real backend / database, authentication, real-time features, SEO optimization, accessibility audit
- **Customization:** None — pure emulation

If the user provides additional instructions (specific fidelity level, customizations, extra context), honor those over the defaults.

## Pre-Flight

1. **Browser automation is required.** Check for available browser MCP tools (Chrome MCP, Playwright MCP, Browserbase MCP, Puppeteer MCP, etc.). Use whichever is available — if multiple exist, prefer Chrome MCP. If none are detected, ask the user which browser tool they have and how to connect it. This skill cannot work without browser automation.
2. Parse `$ARGUMENTS` as one or more URLs. Normalize and validate each URL; if any are invalid, ask the user to correct them before proceeding. For each valid URL, verify it is accessible via your browser MCP tool.
3. Verify the base project builds: `npm run build`. The Next.js + shadcn/ui + Tailwind v4 scaffold should already be in place. If not, tell the user to set it up first.
4. Create the output directories if they don't exist: `docs/research/`, `docs/research/components/`, `docs/design-references/`, `scripts/`. For multiple clones, also prepare per-site folders like `docs/research/<hostname>/` and `docs/design-references/<hostname>/`.
5. When working with multiple sites in one command, optionally confirm whether to run them in parallel (recommended, if resources allow) or sequentially to avoid overload.

## Guiding Principles

These are the truths that separate a successful clone from a "close enough" mess. Internalize them — they should inform every decision you make.

### 1. Completeness Beats Speed

Every builder agent must receive **everything** it needs to do its job perfectly: screenshot, exact CSS values, downloaded assets with local paths, real text content, component structure. If a builder has to guess anything — a color, a font size, a padding value — you have failed at extraction. Take the extra minute to extract one more property rather than shipping an incomplete brief.

### 2. Small Tasks, Perfect Results

When an agent gets "build the entire features section," it glosses over details — it approximates spacing, guesses font sizes, and produces something "close enough" but clearly wrong. When it gets a single focused component with exact CSS values, it nails it every time.

Look at each section and judge its complexity. A simple banner with a heading and a button? One agent. A complex section with 3 different card variants, each with unique hover states and internal layouts? One agent per card variant plus one for the section wrapper. When in doubt, make it smaller.

**Complexity budget rule:** If a builder prompt exceeds ~150 lines of spec content, the section is too complex for one agent. Break it into smaller pieces. This is a mechanical check — don't override it with "but it's all related."

### 3. Real Content, Real Assets

Extract the actual text, images, videos, and SVGs from the live site. This is a clone, not a mockup. Use `element.textContent`, download every `<img>` and `<video>`, extract inline `<svg>` elements as React components. The only time you generate content is when something is clearly server-generated and unique per session.

**Layered assets matter.** A section that looks like one image is often multiple layers — a background watercolor/gradient, a foreground UI mockup PNG, an overlay icon. Inspect each container's full DOM tree and enumerate ALL `<img>` elements and background images within it, including absolutely-positioned overlays. Missing an overlay image makes the clone look empty even if the background is correct.

### 4. Foundation First

Nothing can be built until the foundation exists: global CSS with the target site's design tokens (colors, fonts, spacing), TypeScript types for the content structures, and global assets (fonts, favicons). This is sequential and non-negotiable. Everything after this can be parallel.

### 5. Extract How It Looks AND How It Behaves

A website is not a screenshot — it's a living thing. Elements move, change, appear, and disappear in response to scrolling, hovering, clicking, resizing, and time. If you only extract the static CSS of each element, your clone will look right in a screenshot but feel dead when someone actually uses it.

For every element, extract its **appearance** (exact computed CSS via `getComputedStyle()`) AND its **behavior** (what changes, what triggers the change, and how the transition happens). Not "it looks like 16px" — extract the actual computed value. Not "the nav changes on scroll" — document the exact trigger (scroll position, IntersectionObserver threshold, viewport intersection), the before and after states (both sets of CSS values), and the transition (duration, easing, CSS transition vs. JS-driven vs. CSS `animation-timeline`).

Examples of behaviors to watch for — these are illustrative, not exhaustive. The page may do things not on this list, and you must catch those too:
- A navbar that shrinks, changes background, or gains a shadow after scrolling past a threshold
- Elements that animate into view when they enter the viewport (fade-up, slide-in, stagger delays)
- Sections that snap into place on scroll (`scroll-snap-type`)
- Parallax layers that move at different rates than the scroll
- Hover states that animate (not just change — the transition duration and easing matter)
- Dropdowns, modals, accordions with enter/exit animations
- Scroll-driven progress indicators or opacity transitions
- Auto-playing carousels or cycling content
- Dark-to-light (or any theme) transitions between page sections
- **Tabbed/pill content that cycles** — buttons that switch visible card sets with transitions
- **Scroll-driven tab/accordion switching** — sidebars where the active item auto-changes as content scrolls past (IntersectionObserver, NOT click handlers)
- **Smooth scroll libraries** (Lenis, Locomotive Scroll) — check for `.lenis` class or scroll container wrappers

### 6. Identify the Interaction Model Before Building

This is the single most expensive mistake in cloning: building a click-based UI when the original is scroll-driven, or vice versa. Before writing any builder prompt for an interactive section, you must definitively answer: **Is this section driven by clicks, scrolls, hovers, time, or some combination?**

How to determine this:
1. **Don't click first.** Scroll through the section slowly and observe if things change on their own as you scroll.
2. If they do, it's scroll-driven. Extract the mechanism: `IntersectionObserver`, `scroll-snap`, `position: sticky`, `animation-timeline`, or JS scroll listeners.
3. If nothing changes on scroll, THEN click/hover to test for click/hover-driven interactivity.
4. Document the interaction model explicitly in the component spec: "INTERACTION MODEL: scroll-driven with IntersectionObserver" or "INTERACTION MODEL: click-to-switch with opacity transition."

A section with a sticky sidebar and scrolling content panels is fundamentally different from a tabbed interface where clicking switches content. Getting this wrong means a complete rewrite, not a CSS tweak.

### 7. Extract Every State, Not Just the Default

Many components have multiple visual states — a tab bar shows different cards per tab, a header looks different at scroll position 0 vs 100, a card has hover effects. You must extract ALL states, not just whatever is visible on page load.

For tabbed/stateful content:
- Click each tab/button via browser MCP
- Extract the content, images, and card data for EACH state
- Record which content belongs to which state
- Note the transition animation between states (opacity, slide, fade, etc.)

For scroll-dependent elements:
- Capture computed styles at scroll position 0 (initial state)
- Scroll past the trigger threshold and capture computed styles again (scrolled state)
- Diff the two to identify exactly which CSS properties change
- Record the transition CSS (duration, easing, properties)
- Record the exact trigger threshold (scroll position in px, or viewport intersection ratio)

### 8. Spec Files Are the Source of Truth

Every component gets a specification file in `docs/research/components/` BEFORE any builder is dispatched. This file is the contract between your extraction work and the builder agent. The builder receives the spec file contents inline in its prompt — the file also persists as an auditable artifact that the user (or you) can review if something looks wrong.

The spec file is not optional. It is not a nice-to-have. If you dispatch a builder without first writing a spec file, you are shipping incomplete instructions based on whatever you can remember from a browser MCP session, and the builder will guess to fill gaps.

### 9. Build Must Always Compile

Every builder agent must verify `npx tsc --noEmit` passes before finishing. After merging worktrees, you verify `npm run build` passes. A broken build is never acceptable, even temporarily.

## Phase 1: Reconnaissance

Navigate to the target URL with browser MCP.

### Screenshots
- Take **full-page screenshots** at desktop (1440px) and mobile (390px) viewports
- Save to `docs/design-references/` with descriptive names
- These are your master reference — builders will receive section-specific crops/screenshots later

### Global Extraction
Extract these from the page before doing anything else:

**Fonts** — Inspect `<link>` tags for Google Fonts or self-hosted fonts. Check computed `font-family` on key elements (headings, body, code, labels). Document every family, weight, and style actually used. Configure them in `src/app/layout.tsx` using `next/font/google` or `next/font/local`.

**Colors** — Extract the site's color palette from computed styles across the page. Update `src/app/globals.css` with the target's actual colors in the `:root` and `.dark` CSS variable blocks. Map them to shadcn's token names (background, foreground, primary, muted, etc.) where they fit. Add custom properties for colors that don't map to shadcn tokens.

**Favicons & Meta** — Download favicons, apple-touch-icons, OG images, webmanifest to `public/seo/`. Update `layout.tsx` metadata.

**Global UI patterns** — Identify any site-wide CSS or JS: custom scrollbar hiding, scroll-snap on the page container, global keyframe animations, backdrop filters, gradients used as overlays, **smooth scroll libraries** (Lenis, Locomotive Scroll — check for `.lenis`, `.locomotive-scroll`, or custom scroll container classes). Add these to `globals.css` and note any libraries that need to be installed.

### Mandatory Interaction Sweep

This is a dedicated pass AFTER screenshots and BEFORE anything else. Its purpose is to discover every behavior on the page — many of which are invisible in a static screenshot.

**Scroll sweep:** Scroll the page slowly from top to bottom via browser MCP. At each section, pause and observe:
- Does the header change appearance? Record the scroll position where it triggers.
- Do elements animate into view? Record which ones and the animation type.
- Does a sidebar or tab indicator auto-switch as you scroll? Record the mechanism.
- Are there scroll-snap points? Record which containers.
- Is there a smooth scroll library active? Check for non-native scroll behavior.

**Click sweep:** Click every element that looks interactive:
- Every button, tab, pill, link, card
- Record what happens: does content change? Does a modal open? Does a dropdown appear?
- For tabs/pills: click EACH ONE and record the content that appears for each state

**Hover sweep:** Hover over every element that might have hover states:
- Buttons, cards, links, images, nav items
- Record what changes: color, scale, shadow, underline, opacity

**Responsive sweep:** Test at 3 viewport widths via browser MCP:
- Desktop: 1440px
- Tablet: 768px
- Mobile: 390px
- At each width, note which sections change layout (column → stack, sidebar disappears, etc.) and at approximately which breakpoint the change occurs.

Save all findings to `docs/research/BEHAVIORS.md`. This is your behavior bible — reference it when writing every component spec.

### Page Topology
Map out every distinct section of the page from top to bottom. Give each a working name. Document:
- Their visual order
- Which are fixed/sticky overlays vs. flow content
- The overall page layout (scroll container, column structure, z-index layers)
- Dependencies between sections (e.g., a floating nav that overlays everything)
- **The interaction model** of each section (static, click-driven, scroll-driven, time-driven)

Save this as `docs/research/PAGE_TOPOLOGY.md` — it becomes your assembly blueprint.

## Phase 2: Foundation Build

This is sequential. Do it yourself (not delegated to an agent) since it touches many files:

1. **Update fonts** in `layout.tsx` to match the target site's actual fonts
2. **Update globals.css** with the target's color tokens, spacing values, keyframe animations, utility classes, and any **global scroll behaviors** (Lenis, smooth scroll CSS, scroll-snap on body)
3. **Create TypeScript interfaces** in `src/types/` for the content structures you've observed
4. **Extract SVG icons** — find all inline `<svg>` elements on the page, deduplicate them, and save as named React components in `src/components/icons.tsx`. Name them by visual function (e.g., `SearchIcon`, `ArrowRightIcon`, `LogoIcon`).
5. **Download global assets** — write and run a Node.js script (`scripts/download-assets.mjs`) that downloads all images, videos, and other binary assets from the page to `public/`. Preserve meaningful directory str

# Clone Website

You are about to reverse-engineer and rebuild **$ARGUMENTS** as pixel-perfect clones.

When multiple URLs are provided, process them independently and in parallel where possible, while keeping each site's extraction artifacts isolated in dedicated folders (for example, `docs/research/<hostname>/`).

This is not a two-phase process (inspect then build). You are a **foreman walking the job site** — as you inspect each section of the page, you write a detailed specification to a file, then hand that file to a specialist builder agent with everything they need. Extraction and construction happen in parallel, but extraction is meticulous and produces auditable artifacts.

## Scope Defaults

The target is whatever page `$ARGUMENTS` resolves to. Clone exactly what's visible at that URL. Unless the user specifies otherwise, use these defaults:

- **Fidelity level:** Pixel-perfect — exact match in colors, spacing, typography, animations
- **In scope:** Visual layout and styling, component structure and interactions, responsive design, mock data for demo purposes
- **Out of scope:** Real backend / database, authentication, real-time features, SEO optimization, accessibility audit
- **Customization:** None — pure emulation

If the user provides additional instructions (specific fidelity level, customizations, extra context), honor those over the defaults.

## Pre-Flight

1. **Browser automation is required.** Check for available browser MCP tools (Chrome MCP, Playwright MCP, Browserbase MCP, Puppeteer MCP, etc.). Use whichever is available — if multiple exist, prefer Chrome MCP. If none are detected, ask the user which browser tool they have and how to connect it. This skill cannot work without browser automation.
2. Parse `$ARGUMENTS` as one or more URLs. Normalize and validate each URL; if any are invalid, ask the user to correct them before proceeding. For each valid URL, verify it is accessible via your browser MCP tool.
3. Verify the base project builds: `npm run build`. The Next.js + shadcn/ui + Tailwind v4 scaffold should already be in place. If not, tell the user to set it up first.
4. Create the output directories if they don't exist: `docs/research/`, `docs/research/components/`, `docs/design-references/`, `scripts/`. For multiple clones, also prepare per-site folders like `docs/research/<hostname>/` and `docs/design-references/<hostname>/`.
5. When working with multiple sites in one command, optionally confirm whether to run them in parallel (recommended, if resources allow) or sequentially to avoid overload.

## Guiding Principles

These are the truths that separate a successful clone from a "close enough" mess. Internalize them — they should inform every decision you make.

### 1. Completeness Beats Speed

Every builder agent must receive **everything** it needs to do its job perfectly: screenshot, exact CSS values, downloaded assets with local paths, real text content, component structure. If a builder has to guess anything — a color, a font size, a padding value — you have failed at extraction. Take the extra minute to extract one more property rather than shipping an incomplete brief.

### 2. Small Tasks, Perfect Results

When an agent gets "build the entire features section," it glosses over details — it approximates spacing, guesses font sizes, and produces something "close enough" but clearly wrong. When it gets a single focused component with exact CSS values, it nails it every time.

Look at each section and judge its complexity. A simple banner with a heading and a button? One agent. A complex section with 3 different card variants, each with unique hover states and internal layouts? One agent per card variant plus one for the section wrapper. When in doubt, make it smaller.

**Complexity budget rule:** If a builder prompt exceeds ~150 lines of spec content, the section is too complex for one agent. Break it into smaller pieces. This is a mechanical check — don't override it with "but it's all related."
