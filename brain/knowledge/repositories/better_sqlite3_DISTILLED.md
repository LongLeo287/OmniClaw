# better-sqlite3 [![Build Status](https://github.com/JoshuaWise/better-sqlite3/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/JoshuaWise/better-sqlite3/actions/workflows/build.yml?query=branch%3Amaster)

The fastest and simplest library for SQLite in Node.js.

- Full transaction support
- High performance, efficiency, and safety
- Easy-to-use synchronous API *(better concurrency than an asynchronous API... yes, you read that correctly)*
- Support for user-defined functions, aggregates, virtual tables, and extensions
- 64-bit integers *(invisible until you need them)*
- Worker thread support *(for large/slow queries)*

## Help this project stay strong! &#128170;

`better-sqlite3` is used by thousands of developers and engineers on a daily basis.

> You can verify these results by [running the benchmark yourself](./docs/benchmark.md).

## Installation

```bash
npm install better-sqlite3
```

> Requires a [currently supported Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/about/previous-releases) version. Prebuilt binaries are available for [LTS versions](https://nodejs.org/en/about/previous-releases). If you have trouble installing, check the [troubleshooting guide](./docs/troubleshooting.md).

## Usage

```js
const db = require('better-sqlite3')('foobar.db', options);

const row = db.prepare('SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ?').get(userId);
console.log(row.firstName, row.lastName, row.email);
```

Though not required, [it is generally important to set the WAL pragma for performance reasons](https://github.com/WiseLibs/better-sqlite3/blob/master/docs/performance.md).

```js
db.pragma('journal_mode = WAL');
```

##### In ES6 module notation:

```js
import Database from 'better-sqlite3';
const db = new Database('foobar.db', options);
db.pragma('journal_mode = WAL');
```

## Why should I use this instead of [node-sqlite3](https://github.com/mapbox/node-sqlite3)?

- `node-sqlite3` uses asynchronous APIs for tasks that are either CPU-bound or serialized. That's not only bad design, but it wastes tons of resources. It also causes [mutex thrashing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_contention) which has devastating effects on performance.
- `node-sqlite3` exposes low-level (C language) memory management functions. `better-sqlite3` does it the JavaScript way, allowing the garbage collector to worry about memory management.
- `better-sqlite3` is simpler to use, and it provides nice utilities for some operations that are very difficult or impossible in `node-sqlite3`.
- `better-sqlite3` is much faster than `node-sqlite3` in most cases, and just as fast in all other cases.

#### When is this library not appropriate?

In most cases, if you're attempting something that cannot be reasonably accomplished with `better-sqlite3`, it probably cannot be reasonably accomplished with SQLite in general. For example, if you're executing queries that take one second to complete, and you expect to have many concurrent users executing those queries, no amount of asynchronicity will save you from SQLite's serialized nature. Fortunately, SQLite is very *very* fast. With proper indexing, we've been able to achieve upward of 2000 queries per second with 5-way-joins in a 60 GB database, where each query was handling 5–50 kilobytes of real data.

If you have a performance problem, the most likely causes are inefficient queries, improper indexing, or a lack of [WAL mode](./docs/performance.md)—not `better-sqlite3` itself. However, there are some cases where `better-sqlite3` could be inappropriate:

- If you expect a high volume of concurrent reads each returning many megabytes of data (i.e., videos)
- If you expect a high volume of concurrent writes (i.e., a social media site)
- If your database's size is near the terabyte range

For these situations, you should probably use a full-fledged RDBMS such as [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/).

## Upgrading

Upgrading your `better-sqlite3` dependency can potentially introduce breaking changes, either in the `better-sqlite3` API (if you upgrade to a new [major version](https://semver.org/)), or between your existing database(s) and the underlying version of SQLite. Before upgrading, review:

* [`better-sqlite3` release notes](https://github.com/WiseLibs/better-sqlite3/releases)
* [SQLite release history](https://www.sqlite.org/changes.html)

### new Database(*path*, [*options*])

Creates a new database connection. If the database file does not exist, it is created. This happens synchronously, which means you can start executing queries right away. You can create an [in-memory database](https://www.sqlite.org/inmemorydb.html) by passing `":memory:"` as the first argument. You can create a temporary database by passing an empty string (or by omitting all arguments).

> In-memory databases can also be created by passing a buffer returned by [`.serialize()`](#serializeoptions---buffer), instead of passing a string as the first argument.

Various options are accepted:

- `options.readonly`: open the database connection in readonly mode (default: `false`).

- `options.fileMustExist`: if the database does not exist, an `Error` will be thrown instead of creating a new file. This option is ignored for in-memory, temporary, or readonly database connections (default: `false`).

- `options.timeout`: the number of milliseconds to wait when executing queries on a locked database, before throwing a `SQLITE_BUSY` error (default: `5000`).

- `options.verbose`: provide a function that gets called with every SQL string executed by the database connection (default: `null`).

- `options.nativeBinding`: if you're using a complicated build system that moves, transforms, or concatenates your JS files, `better-sqlite3` might have trouble locating its native C++ addon (`better_sqlite3.node`). If you get an error that looks like [this](https://github.com/JoshuaWise/better-sqlite3/issues/534#issuecomment-757907190), you can solve it by using this option to provide the file path of `better_sqlite3.node` (relative to the current working directory).

```js
const Database = require('better-sqlite3');
const db = new Database('foobar.db', { verbose: console.log });
```

### .prepare(*string*) -> *Statement*

Creates a new prepared [`Statement`](#class-statement) from the given SQL string.

```js
const stmt = db.prepare('SELECT name, age FROM cats');
```

### .transaction(*function*) -> *function*

Creates a function that always runs inside a [transaction](https://sqlite.org/lang_transaction.html). When the function is invoked, it will begin a new transaction. When the function returns, the transaction will be committed. If an exception is thrown, the transaction will be rolled back (and the exception will propagate as usual).

```js
const insert = db.prepare('INSERT INTO cats (name, age) VALUES (@name, @age)');

const insertMany = db.transaction((cats) => {
  for (const cat of cats) insert.run(cat);
});

insertMany([
  { name: 'Joey', age: 2 },
  { name: 'Sally', age: 4 },
  { name: 'Junior', age: 1 },
]);
```

Transaction functions can be called from inside other transaction functions. When doing so, the inner transaction becomes a [savepoint](https://www.sqlite.org/lang_savepoint.html).

If an error is thrown inside of a nested transaction function, the nested transaction function will roll back to the state just before the savepoint and rethrow the error. If the error is not caught in the outer transaction function, this will cause the outer transaction function to roll back as well.

```js
const newExpense = db.prepare('INSERT INTO expenses (note, dollars) VALUES (?, ?)');

const adopt = db.transaction((cats) => {
  newExpense.run('adoption fees', 20);
  insertMany(cats); // nested transaction
});
```

Transactions also come with `deferred`, `immediate`, and `exclusive` versions.

```js
insertMany(cats); // uses "BEGIN"
insertMany.deferred(cats); // uses "BEGIN DEFERRED"
insertMany.immediate(cats); // uses "BEGIN IMMEDIATE"
insertMany.exclusive(cats); // uses "BEGIN EXCLUSIVE"
```

Any arguments passed to the transaction function will be forwarded to the wrapped function, and any values returned from the wrapped function will be returned from the transaction function. The wrapped function will also have access to the same [`this`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/this) binding as the transaction function.

#### Caveats

If you'd like to manage transactions manually, you're free to do so with regular [prepared statements](#preparestring---statement) (using `BEGIN`, `COMMIT`, etc.). However, manually managed transactions should not be mixed with transactions managed by this `.transaction()` method. In other words, using raw `COMMIT` or `ROLLBACK` statements inside a transaction function is not supported.

Transaction functions do not work with async functions. Technically speaking, async functions always return after the first `await`, which means the transaction will already be committed before any async code executes. Also, because SQLite serializes all transactions, it's generally a very bad idea to keep a transaction open across event loop ticks anyways.

It's important to know that SQLite may sometimes rollback a transaction without us asking it to. This can happen either because of an [`ON CONFLICT`](https://sqlite.org/lang_conflict.html) clause, the [`RAISE()`](https://www.sqlite.org/lang_createtrigger.html) trigger function, or certain errors such as `SQLITE_FULL` or `SQLITE_BUSY`. In other words, if you catch an SQLite error *within* a transaction, you must be aware that any further SQL that you execute might not be within the same transaction. Usually, the best course of action for such cases is to simply re-throw the error, exiting the transaction function.

```js
try {
  ...
} catch (err) {
  if (!db.inTransaction) throw err; // (transaction was forcefully rolled back)
  ...
}
```

### .pragma(*string*, [*options*]) -> *results*

Executes the given PRAGMA and returns its result. By default, the return value will be an array of result rows. Each row is represented by an object whose keys correspond to column names.

Since most PRAGMA statements return a single value, the `simple` option is provided to make things easier. When `simple` is `true`, only the first column of the first row will be returned.

```js
db.pragma('cache_size = 32000');
console.log(db.pragma('cache_size', { simple: true })); // => 32000
```

If execution of the PRAGMA fails, an `Error` is thrown.

It's better to use this method instead of normal [prepared statements](#preparestring---statement) when executing PRAGMA, because this method normalizes some odd behavior that may otherwise be experienced. The documentation on SQLite PRAGMA can be found [here](https://www.sqlite.org/pragma.html).

### .backup(*destination*, [*options*]) -> *promise*

Initiates a [backup](https://www.sqlite.org/backup.html) of the database, returning a [promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Using_promises) for when the backup is complete. If the backup fails, the promise will be rejected with an `Error`. You can optionally backup an attached database instead by setting the `attached` option to the name of the desired attached database. A backup file is just a regular SQLite database file. It can be opened by [`new Database()`](#new-databasepath-options) just like any SQLite database.

```js
db.backup(`backup-${Date.now()}.db`)
  .then(() => {
    console.log('backup complete!');
  })
  .catch((err) => {
    console.log('backup failed:', err);
  });
```

You can continue to use the database normally while a backup is in progress. If the same database connection mutates the database while performing a backup, those mutations will be reflected in the backup automatically. However, if a *different* connection mutates the database during a backup, the backup will be forcefully restarted. Therefore, it's recommended that only a single connection is responsible for mutating the database if online backups are being performed.

You can monitor the progress of the backup by setting the `progress` option to a callback function. That function will be invoked every time the backup makes progress, providing an object with two properties:

- `.totalPages`: the total number of pages in the source database (and thus, the number of pages that the backup will have when completed) at the time of this progress report.
- `.remainingPages`: the number of pages that still must be transferred before the backup is complete.

By default, `100` [pages](https://www.sqlite.org/fileformat.html#pages) will be transferred after each cycle of the event loop. However, you can change this setting as often as you like by returning a number from the `progress` callback. You can even return `0` to effectively pause the backup altogether. In general, the goal is to maximize throughput while reducing pause times. If the transfer size is very low, pause times will be low, but it may take a while to complete the backup. On the flip side, if the setting is too high, pause times will be greater, but the backup might complete sooner. In most cases, `100` has proven to be a strong compromise, but the best setting is dependent on your computer's specifications and the nature of your program. Do not change this setting without measuring the effectiveness of your change. You should not assume that your change will even have the intended effect, unless you measure it for your unique situation.

If the backup is successful, the returned promise will contain an object that has the same properties as the one provided to the `progress` callback, but `.remainingPages` will be `0`. If the `progress` callback throws an exception, the backup will be aborted. Usually this happens due to an unexpected error, but you can also use this behavior to voluntarily cancel the backup operation. If the parent database connection is closed, all pending backups will be automatically aborted.

```js
let paused = false;
db.backup(`backup-${Date.now()}.db`, {
  progress({ totalPages: t, remainingPages: r }) {
    console.log(`progress: ${((t - r) / t * 100).toFixed(1)}%`);
    return paused ? 0 : 200;
  }
});
```

### .serialize([*options*]) -> *Buffer*

Returns a [buffer](https://nodejs.org/api/buffer.html#buffer_class_buffer) containing the serialized contents of the database. You can optionally serialize an attached database instead by setting the `attached` option to the name of the desired attached database.

The returned buffer can be written to disk to create a regular SQLite database file, or it can be opened directly as an in-memory database by passing it to [`new Database()`](#new-databasepath-options).

```js
const buffer = db.serialize();
db.close();
db = new Database(buffer);
```

### .function(*name*, [*options*], *function*) -> *this*

Registers a user-defined `function` so that it can be used by SQL statements.

```js
db.function('add2', (a, b) => a + b);

db.prepare('SELECT add2(?, ?)').pluck().get(12, 4); // => 16
db.prepare('SELECT add2(?, ?)').pluck().get('foo', 'bar'); // => "foobar"
db.prepare('SELECT add2(?, ?, ?)').pluck().get(12, 4, 18); // => Error: wrong number of arguments
```

By default, user-defined functions have a strict number of arguments (determined by `function.length`). You can register multiple functions of the same name, each with a different number of arguments, causing SQLite to execute a different function depending on how many arguments were passed to it. If you register two functions with same name and the same number of arguments, the second registration will erase the first one.

If `options.varargs` is `true`, the registered function can accept any number of arguments.

If `options.directOnly` is `true`, the registered function can only be invoked from top-level SQL, and cannot be used in [VIEWs](https://sqlite.org/lang_createview.html), [TRIGGERs](https://sqlite.org/lang_createtrigger.html), or schema structures such as [CHECK constraints](https://www.sqlite.org/lang_createtable.html#ckconst), [DEFAULT clauses](https://www.sqlite.org/lang_createtable.html#dfltval), etc.

If your function is [deterministic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deterministic_algorithm), you can set `options.deterministic` to `true`, which may improve performance under some circumstances.

```js
db.function('void', { deterministic: true, varargs: true }, () => {});

db.prepare("SELECT void()").pluck().get(); // => null
db.prepare("SELECT void(?, ?)").pluck().get(55, 19); // => null
```

### .aggregate(*name*, *options*) -> *this*

Registers a user-defined [aggregate function](https://sqlite.org/lang_aggfunc.html).

```js
db.aggregate('addAll', {
  start: 0,
  step: (total, nextValue) => total + nextValue,
});

db.prepare('SELECT addAll(dollars) FROM expenses').pluck().get(); // => 92
```

The `step()` function will be invoked once for each row passed to the aggregate, using its return value as the new aggregate value. This works similarly to [Array#reduce()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/Reduce).

If `options.start` is a function, it will be invoked at the beginning of each aggregate, using its return value as the initial aggregate value. If `options.start` is *not* a function, it will be used as the initial aggregate value *as-is* (shown in the example above). If not provided, the initial aggregate value will be `null`.

You can also provide a `result()` function to transform the final aggregate value:

```js
db.aggregate('getAverage', {
  start: () => [],
  step: (array, nextValue) => {
    array.push(nextValue);
  },
  result: array => array.reduce(sum) / array.length,
});

db.prepare('SELECT getAverage(dollars) FROM expenses').pluck().get(); // => 20.2
```

As shown above, you can use arbitrary JavaScript objects as your aggregation context, as long as a valid SQLite value is returned by `result()` in the end. If `step()` doesn't return anything (`undefined`), the aggregate value will not be replaced (be careful of this when using functions that return `undefined` when `null` is desired).

Just like regular [user-defined functions](#functionname-options-function---this), user-defined aggregates can accept multiple arguments. Furthermore, `options.varargs`, `options.directOnly`, and `options.deterministic` [are also](#functionname-options-function---this) accep

# Custom configuration

If you want to use a customized version of [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org) with `better-sqlite3`, you can do so by specifying the directory of your [custom amalgamation](https://www.sqlite.org/amalgamation.html) during installation.

```bash
npm install better-sqlite3 --build-from-source --sqlite3=/path/to/sqlite-amalgamation
```

However, if you simply run `npm install` while `better-sqlite3` is listed as a dependency in your `package.json`, the required flags above will *not* be applied. Therefore, it's recommended that you remove `better-sqlite3` from your dependency list, and instead add a [`preinstall` script](https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/scripts) like the one shown below.

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "preinstall": "npm install better-sqlite3@'^7.0.0' --no-save --build-from-source --sqlite3=\"$(pwd)/sqlite-amalgamation\""
  }
}
```

Your amalgamation directory must contain `sqlite3.c` and `sqlite3.h`. Any desired [compile time options](https://www.sqlite.org/compile.html) must be defined directly within `sqlite3.c`, as shown below.

```c
// These go at the top of the file
#define SQLITE_ENABLE_FTS5 1
#define SQLITE_DEFAULT_CACHE_SIZE 16000

// ... the original content of the file remains below
```

### Step by step example

If you're creating a package that relies on a custom build of `better-sqlite3`, you can follow these steps to get started.

1. Download the SQLite source code from [their website](https://sqlite.com/download.html) (e.g., `sqlite-amalgamation-1234567.zip`)
2. Unzip the compressed archive
3. Move the `sqlite3.c` and `sqlite3.h` files to your project folder
4. Add a `preinstall` script to your `package.json`, like the one shown above
6. Make sure the `--sqlite3` flag points to the location of your `sqlite3.c` and `sqlite3.h` files
7. Define your preferred [compile time options](https://www.sqlite.org/compile.html) at the top of `sqlite3.c`
8. Make sure to remove `better-sqlite3` from your `dependencies`
9. Run `npm install` in your project folder

If you're using a SQLite encryption extension that is a drop-in replacement for SQLite (such as [SEE](https://www.sqlite.org/see/doc/release/www/readme.wiki) or [sqleet](https://github.com/resilar/sqleet)), then simply replace `sqlite3.c` and `sqlite3.h` with the source files of your encryption extension.

# Code of conduct

Topics of discussion are expected to be constrained such that all discussion is relevant to the following goals:

- Maintaining `better-sqlite3`'s code, documentation, and build artifacts
- Helping people *get started* in using `better-sqlite3` within their software projects

Other areas of discussion are considered to be off-topic, including but not limited to:

- Politics
- Name-calling, insults
- Help with using SQLite (there's already [very good documentation](https://sqlite.org/docs.html) for that)
- Help with application architecture, and other high-level decisions about software projects
- Attention to personal traits such as race, gender, religion, national origin, sexual orientation, disability, etc.

Repeated offenses against this code of conduct may result in being temporarily banned from the community. Unofficially, the community is expected to maintain a manner of professionalism and to treat others with respect.

Attempting to physically seize, sabotage, or distribute malware through `better-sqlite3` will result in being permanently banned from the community, without warning.

# Contribution

## Introduction and scope

`better-sqlite3` is a low-level Node.js package that provides bindings to [SQLite](https://sqlite.org/index.html). `better-sqlite3` is not an ORM, and does not lend itself to specific types of applications or frameworks.

Anything that SQLite does not directly provide is considered out-of-scope for `better-sqlite3`. Anything that SQLite *does* directly provide *may* be considered in-scope for `better-sqlite3`, with the additional requirements that it:

- can be implemented sensibly and safely (i.e., it cannot lead to [undefined behavior](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Undefined_behavior))
- is used commonly enough to warrant the extra code complexity that it brings
- cannot be reasonably implemented by a user in JavaScript (e.g., by monkey-patching)

#### Native addons

`better-sqlite3` is a combination of JavaScript and C++. The C++ part is necessary in order to communicate with the [underlying SQLite library](https://sqlite.org/index.html), which is written in C. Node.js supports [C++ addons](https://nodejs.org/api/addons.html) through a build system called [`node-gyp`](https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp), which is automatically bundled with every installation of [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/about-npm). On most systems, C++ addons will simply be compiled as part of the installation process when running `npm install`. However, [history has shown](https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp/issues/629) that Windows users have struggled significantly when trying to build C++ addons for Node.js. This is an issue with Node.js as a whole, and not specific to `better-sqlite3`.

#### Electron

`better-sqlite3` is a Node.js package, *not* an [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/) package. Electron is considered a third-party platform that is not officially supported. However, many users do find great success in using `better-sqlite3` with Electron, and helpful contributors such as [@mceachen](https://github.com/mceachen) have provided support to the Electron community.

#### TypeScript

Lastly, `better-sqlite3` is a JavaScript package, not a TypeScript package. Type definitions have been generously provided by the community at [`@types/better-sqlite3`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@types/better-sqlite3), but no official support for TypeScript is currently provided (this may change in the future).

## Principles

Code that gets contributed to `better-sqlite3` must adhere to the following principles, prioritized from first to last:

#### 1) Correctness

The code must behave as expected in all situations. Often when writing new features, only the nominal case is considered. However, many edge cases exist when you consider race conditions, uncommon states, and improper usage. All possibilities of improper usage must be detected, and an appropriate error must be thrown (never ignored). All possibilities of proper usage must be supported, and must behave as expected.

#### 2) Simplicity

`better-sqlite3`'s public API must be as simple as possible. Rather than calling 3 functions in a specific order, it's simpler for users to call a single function. Rather than providing many similar functions for doing similar things (e.g., "convenience functions"), there should just be one function that is already convenient by design. Sane defaults should be applied when possible. A function's minimal call signature should be as small as possible, with progressively complex customization available when needed. Function names should only be as long as necessary to convey their purpose. For any new feature, it should be easy to showcase code examples that is are so simple that they are self-explanatory.

> This principle only applies to the public API, not necessarily to internal functions.

#### 3) Readability

Code must be written in a way that is intuitive and understandable by other programmers, now and in the future. Some code is naturally complex, and thus should be explained with comments (only when necessary). Code should be written in a style that is similar to existing code.

#### 4) Performance

Code should be written such that it does not use unnecessary computing resources. If a task can be accomplished without copying a potentially large buffer, it should be. If a complex algorithm can generally be avoided with a simple check, it should be. Calls to the operating system or filesystem should be limited to only occur when absolutely necessary. The public API should naturally encourage good performance habits, such as re-using prepared statements.

> It's okay to sacrifice readability for performance if doing so has a clear, measurable benefit to users.

## How to contribute

If you've never written a native addon for Node.js before, you should start by reading the [official documentation](https://nodejs.org/api/addons.html) on the subject.

#### C++

The C++ code in `better-sqlite3` uses standard C++ source files (`.cpp`) and header files (`.hpp`). All source files and header files are compiled into a single translation unit (i.e., a ["unity build"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unity_build)). Compared to linking many small translation units, this method improves the compiler's ability to optimize code, and enhances compilation speed.

#### Style guide

There is currently no linter or style guide associated with `better-sqlite3` (this may change in the future). For now, just try to match the style of existing code as much as possible. Code owners will reject your PR or rewrite your changes if they feel that you've used a coding style that doesn't match the existing code. Although the rules aren't laid out formally, you are expected to adhere to them by using your eyeballs.

#### Testing

All tests are written in JavaScript, and they test `better-sqlite3`'s public API. All new features must be accompanied by a robust set of tests that scrutinize the new feature under all manner of circumstances and edge cases. It's not enough to simply test the "common case". If you write code that detects errors and throws exceptions, those error cases should be tested too, to ensure that all errors are being properly detected. If a new feature interacts with existing features, those interactions must be tested as well.

#### Documentation

All new features must be accompanied by [clear documentation](./api.md). All new methods and classes must be included in the [Table of Contents](./api.md#api), and must include code examples. Documentation must follow the existing formatting:

- Literal values use monospace code formatting
	- Examples: `"my string"`, `true`, `false`, `null`, `undefined`, `123`
- Package names and code identifiers use monospace code formatting
	- Examples: `better-sqlite3`, `db.myMethod()`, `options.readOnly`, `this`
- Primitive data types are lower-cased, while other data types are capitalized
	- Examples: `string`, `number`, `Buffer`, `Database`
- References to other classes or methods must be linked and use monospace code formatting
	- Examples: [`.get()`](./api.md#getbindparameters---row), [`new Database()`](./api.md#new-databasepath-options)
- Function signatures are written as: .funcName(*requiredArg*, [*optionalArg*]) -> *returnValue*
	- Note that the arguments and return values are *italicized*
	- Note that optional arguments are surrounded by square brackets []
- All code blocks should be highlighted using `js` syntax, except for bash commands which don't need highlighting

## Categories of contribution

Depending on the nature of your contribution, it will be held to a different level of scrutiny, from lowest to highest:

#### 1) General maintenance

These changes are self-explanatory. They include:

- Updating the bundled version of SQLite (using [this workflow](https://github.com/WiseLibs/better-sqlite3/actions/workflows/update-sqlite.yml))
- Updating dependencies in `package.json`
- Adding prebuild binaries for a new version of Node.js or Electron
- Adding prebuild binaries for a new architecture or operating system

These kinds of updates happen on a regular basis, and require zero knowledge of `better-sqlite3`'s code. Trusted contributors can merge these changes without approval from the original author.

#### 2) Documentation

Changes to documentation are usually helpful and harmless. However, they should be treated with a higher level of scrutiny because they affect how users learn about and use `better-sqlite3`. Importance is placed on the correctness and truthfulness of documentation. For example, documentation should not "go out of date" based on events outside of our control.

Depending on the type of documentation, trusted contributors might be able to merge these changes without approval from the original author.

#### 3) Minor quality-of-life improvements

These are code changes with a very small blast radius, such as adding a new read-only property to an object, or augmenting a function with a new option that gets passed directly to SQLite. These changes are *probably* harmless, but require additional scrutiny because they must be thoroughly tested and documented. These changes must be completely backwards-compatible, unless they're part of a major version update.

> It's considered a backwards-**incompatible** change for a prebuilt binary to be removed.

#### 4) New features

These are code changes with a substantial blast radius, such as implementing a new class or method. These changes must be completely backwards-compatible, unless they're part of a major version update.

New features are rarely accepted from external contributors because they are rarely held to the extremely high standard that `better-sqlite3` sets for itself. New features must behave correctly in all possible circumstances, including race conditions and edge cases. Likewise, even the most obscure circumstances must have test cases covering them.

When implementing a new feature, ask yourself:

- What could go wrong if I use this feature while executing a [user-defined function](./api.md#functionname-options-function---this)?
- What could go wrong if I use this feature while [iterating](./api.md#iteratebindparameters---iterator) through a prepared statement?
- What could go wrong if I use this feature while the database is [closed](./api.md#close---this)?
- What could go wrong if I use this feature from within the [verbose callback](./api.md#new-databasepath-options)?
- What could go wrong if I use this feature from within a [transaction](./api.md#transactionfunction---function)?
- What could go wrong if I use this feature on a prepared statement that has [bound parameters](./api.md#bindbindparameters---this)?
- What could go wrong if I use this feature within a [worker thread](./threads.md#worker-threads)?
- What could go wrong if I pass the wrong data type?
- What could go wrong if I pass an unexpected value, such as `null`, `undefined`, `""`, `NaN`, a negative/non-integer number, etc.?
- Should the user's [64-bit integer setting](integer.md#the-bigint-primitive-type) affect this feature?
- If this feature accepts a callback function:
	- What could go wrong if that callback function throws an exception?
	- What could go wrong if that callback function is triggered during one of the above scenarios?
- Could this feature cause memory leaks?
	- What if a C++ object gets garbage-collected from JavaScript while it has open handles?
	- What if a JavaScript error is thrown within a callback, after I allocated a C++ object?

People love `better-sqlite3` because of its robustness and reliability. Each and every feature of `better-sqlite3` accounts for every single scenario listed above. Additionally, all possible error scenarios are explicitly handled and tested. Any new feature of `better-sqlite3` must be held to the same standard. Currently, no new features are merged without approval from the original author.

## Creating a release

Trusted contributors have the privileges necessary to create a release. Here are the steps to create a release:

1. Run [this workflow](https://github.com/WiseLibs/better-sqlite3/actions/workflows/bump-version.yml) from the `master` branch to create a new version tag
	- Select `patch` for bug fixes and general maintenance
	- Select `minor` for larger releases with new features
	- Select `major` for releases with backwards-incompatible changes
2. [Draft a new release](https://github.com/WiseLibs/better-sqlite3/releases/new), and select the version tag that you just created
3. Leave the "Release title" blank, and click "Auto-generate release notes"
4. Click "Publish release"
5. Wait for the `build` job to complete ([here](https://github.com/WiseLibs/better-sqlite3/actions))

# The `BigInt` primitive type

SQLite can store data in 64-bit signed integers, which are too big for JavaScript's [number format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-precision_floating-point_format) to fully represent. To support this data type, `better-sqlite3` is fully compatible with [BigInts](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/BigInt).

```js
const big = BigInt('1152735103331642317');
big === 1152735103331642317n; // returns true
big.toString(); // returns "1152735103331642317"
typeof big; // returns "bigint"
```

## Binding BigInts

`BigInts` can bind to [`Statements`](./api.md#class-statement) just like regular numbers. You can also return `BigInts` from [user-defined functions](./api.md#functionname-options-function---this). However, if you provide a `BigInt` that's too large to be a 64-bit signed integer, you'll get an error so that data integrity is protected.

```js
db.prepare("SELECT * FROM users WHERE id=?").get(BigInt('1152735103331642317'));
db.prepare("INSERT INTO users (id) VALUES (?)").run(BigInt('1152735103331642317'));

db.prepare("SELECT ?").get(2n ** 63n - 1n); // returns successfully
db.prepare("SELECT ?").get(2n ** 63n); // throws a RangeError
```

## Getting BigInts from the database

By default, integers returned from the database (including the [`info.lastInsertRowid`](./api.md#runbindparameters---object) property) are normal JavaScript numbers. You can change this default as you please:

```js
db.defaultSafeIntegers(); // BigInts by default
db.defaultSafeIntegers(true); // BigInts by default
db.defaultSafeIntegers(false); // Numbers by default
```

Additionally, you can override the default for individual [`Statements`](./api.md#class-statement) like so:

```js
const stmt = db.prepare(SQL);

stmt.safeIntegers(); // Safe integers ON
stmt.safeIntegers(true); // Safe integers ON
stmt.safeIntegers(false); // Safe integers OFF
```

[User-defined functions](./api.md#functionname-options-function---this) can receive `BigInts` as arguments. You can override the database's default setting like so:

```js
db.function('isInt', { safeIntegers: true }, (value) => {
  return String(typeof value === 'bigint');
});

db.prepare('SELECT isInt(?)').pluck().get(10); // => "false"
db.prepare('SELECT isInt(?)').pluck().get(10n); // => "true"
```

Likewise, [user-defined aggregates](./api.md#aggregatename-options---this) and [virtual tables](./api.md#tablename-definition---this) can also receive `BigInts` as arguments:

```js
db.aggregate('addInts', {
  safeIntegers: true,
  start: 0n,
  step: (total, nextValue) => total + nextValue,
});
```

```js
db.table('sequence', {
  safeIntegers: true,
  columns: ['value'],
  parameters: ['length', 'start'],
  rows: function* (length, start = 0n) {
    const end = start + length;
    for (let n = start; n < end; ++n) {
      yield { value: n };
    }
  },
});
```

It's worth noting that REAL (FLOAT) values returned from the database will always be represented as normal numbers.

# Performance

Concurrently reading and writing from an SQLite database can be very slow in some cases. Since concurrency is usually very important in web applications, it's recommended to turn on [WAL mode](https://www.sqlite.org/wal.html) to greatly increase overall performance.

```js
db.pragma('journal_mode = WAL');
```

WAL mode has a *few* disadvantages to consider:

- Transactions that involve ATTACHed databases are atomic for each individual database, but are not atomic across all databases as a set.
- Under rare circumstances, the [WAL file](https://www.sqlite.org/wal.html) may experience "checkpoint starvation" (see below).
- There are some hardware/system limitations that may affect some users, [listed here](https://www.sqlite.org/wal.html).

However, you trade those disadvantages for extremely fast performance in most web applications.

## Checkpoint starvation

Checkpoint starvation is when SQLite is unable to recycle the [WAL file](https://www.sqlite.org/wal.html) due to everlasting concurrent reads to the database. If this happens, the WAL file will grow without bound, leading to unacceptable amounts of disk usage and deteriorating performance.

If you don't access the database from multiple processes or threads simultaneously, you'll never encounter this issue.

If you do access the database from multiple processes or threads simultaneously, just use the [`wal_checkpoint(RESTART)`](https://www.sqlite.org/pragma.html#pragma_wal_checkpoint) pragma when the WAL file gets too big.

```js
setInterval(fs.stat.bind(null, 'foobar.db-wal', (err, stat) => {
  if (err) {
    if (err.code !== 'ENOENT') throw err;
  } else if (stat.size > someUnacceptableSize) {
    db.pragma('wal_checkpoint(RESTART)');
  }
}), 5000).unref();
```

## A note about durability

This distribution of SQLite uses the `SQLITE_DEFAULT_WAL_SYNCHRONOUS=1` [compile-time option](https://sqlite.org/compile.html#default_wal_synchronous), which makes databases in WAL mode default to the ["NORMAL" synchronous setting](https://sqlite.org/pragma.html#pragma_synchronous). This allows applications to achieve extreme performance, but introduces a slight loss of [durability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Durability_(database_systems)) while in WAL mode.

You can override this setting by running `db.pragma('synchronous = FULL')`.

```

# Worker threads

For most applications, `better-sqlite3` is fast enough to use in the main thread without blocking for a noticeable amount of time. However, if you need to perform very slow queries, you have the option of using [worker threads](https://nodejs.org/api/worker_threads.html) to keep things running smoothly. Below is an example of using a thread pool to perform queries in the background.

### worker.js

The worker logic is very simple in our case. It accepts messages from the master thread, executes each message's SQL (with any given parameters), and sends back the query results.

```js
const { parentPort } = require('worker_threads');
const db = require('better-sqlite3')('foobar.db');

parentPort.on('message', ({ sql, parameters }) => {
  const result = db.prepare(sql).all(...parameters);
  parentPort.postMessage(result);
});
```

### master.js

The master thread is responsible for spawning workers, respawning threads that crash, and accepting query jobs.

```js
const { Worker } = require('worker_threads');
const os = require('os');

/*
  Export a function that queues pending work.
 */

const queue = [];
exports.asyncQuery = (sql, ...parameters) => {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    queue.push({
      resolve,
      reject,
      message: { sql, parameters },
    });
    drainQueue();
  });
};

/*
  Instruct workers to drain the queue.
 */

let workers = [];
function drainQueue() {
  for (const worker of workers) {
    worker.takeWork();
  }
}

/*
  Spawn workers that try to drain the queue.
 */

new Array(os.availableParallelism()).fill(null).forEach(function spawn() {
  const worker = new Worker('./worker.js');

  let job = null; // Current item from the queue
  let error = null; // Error that caused the worker to crash

  function takeWork() {
    if (!job && queue.length) {
      // If there's a job in the queue, send it to the worker
      job = queue.shift();
      worker.postMessage(job.message);
    }
  }

  worker
    .on('online', () => {
      workers.push({ takeWork });
      takeWork();
    })
    .on('message', (result) => {
      job.resolve(result);
      job = null;
      takeWork(); // Check if there's more work to do
    })
    .on('error', (err) => {
      console.error(err);
      error = err;
    })
    .on('exit', (code) => {
      workers = workers.filter(w => w.takeWork !== takeWork);
      if (job) {
        job.reject(error || new Error('worker died'));
      }
      if (code !== 0) {
        console.error(`worker exited with code ${code}`);
        spawn(); // Worker died, so spawn a new one
      }
    });
});
```

# Helpful tips for SQLite

## Creating good tables

It's a good idea to use `INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT` as one of the columns in a table. This ensures two things:

- `INTEGER PRIMARY KEY`: improved performance by reusing SQLite's built-in `rowid` column.
- `AUTOINCREMENT`: no future row will have the same ID as an old one that was deleted. This can prevent potential bugs and security breaches.

If you don't use `INTEGER PRIMARY KEY`, then you *must* use `NOT NULL` in all of your your primary key columns. Otherwise you'll be victim to an SQLite bug that allows primary keys to be `NULL`.

Any column with `INTEGER PRIMARY KEY` will automatically increment when setting its value to `NULL`. But without `AUTOINCREMENT`, the behavior only ensures uniqueness from currently existing rows.

It should be noted that `NULL` values count as unique from each other. This has implications when using the `UNIQUE` contraint or any other equality test.

## Default values

When a column has a `DEFAULT` value, it only gets applied when no value is specified for an `INSERT` statement. If the `INSERT` statement specifies a `NULL` value, the `DEFAULT` value is **NOT** used.

## Foreign keys

Foreign key constraints are not enforced if the child's column value is `NULL`. To ensure that a relationship is always enforced, use `NOT NULL` on the child column.

Example:
```sql
CREATE TABLE comments (value TEXT, user_id INTEGER NOT NULL REFERENCES users);
```

Foreign key clauses can be followed by `ON DELETE` and/or `ON UPDATE`, with the following possible values:

- `SET NULL`: if the parent column is deleted or updated, the child column becomes `NULL`.
  - *NOTE: This still causes a constraint violation if the child column has `NOT NULL`*.
- `SET DEFAULT`: if the parent column is updated or deleted, the child column becomes its `DEFAULT` value.
  - *NOTE: This still causes a constraint violation if the child column's `DEFAULT` value does not correspond with an actual parent row*.
- `CASCADE`: if the parent row is deleted, the child row is deleted; if the parent column is updated, the new value is propagated to the child column.

```

# Troubleshooting installation

If `better-sqlite3` refuses to install, follow these guidelines:

## Use the latest version of better-sqlite3

- Check the [releases page](https://github.com/WiseLibs/better-sqlite3/releases) to make sure you're using the latest and greatest.

## Install a recent Node.js

- Make sure you're using a [supported version of Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/about/previous-releases). `better-sqlite3` is only tested with currently-supported versions of Node.js.

## "Install the necessary tools" 
   
- If you're on Windows, during installation of Node.js, be sure to select "Automatically install the necessary tools" from the "Tools for Native Modules" page.

- If you missed this when you installed Node.js, double-click `C:\Program Files\nodejs\install_tools.bat` from the File Explorer or run it in a terminal.

This will open an administrative PowerShell terminal and installing Chocolatey, Visual Studio, and Python.

This may take several minutes.

## No special characters in your project path

- Make sure there are no spaces in your project path: `node-gyp` may not escape spaces or special characters (like `%` or `$`) properly.

## Electron

1. If you're using [Electron](https://github.com/electron/electron), use [`electron-rebuild`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/electron-rebuild).

2. If you're using an app.asar bundle, be sure all native libraries are "unpacked". If you're using [electron-forge]([url](https://www.electronforge.io)), you should use the [auto-unpack-natives plugin](https://www.electronforge.io/config/plugins/auto-unpack-natives)

## Windows

If you still have issues, try these steps:

1. Delete your `node_modules` subdirectory
1. Delete your `$HOME/.node-gyp` directory
1. Run `npm install`

## Still stuck?

Browse [previous installation issues](https://github.com/WiseLibs/better-sqlite3/issues?q=is%3Aissue).
