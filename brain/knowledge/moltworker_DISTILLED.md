# OpenClaw on Cloudflare Workers

Run [OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw) (formerly Moltbot, formerly Clawdbot) personal AI assistant in a [Cloudflare Sandbox](https://developers.cloudflare.com/sandbox/).

![moltworker architecture](./assets/logo.png)

> **Experimental:** This is a proof of concept demonstrating that OpenClaw can run in Cloudflare Sandbox. It is not officially supported and may break without notice. Use at your own risk.

[![Deploy to Cloudflare](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/button)](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/?url=https://github.com/cloudflare/moltworker)

## Requirements

- [Workers Paid plan](https://www.cloudflare.com/plans/developer-platform/) ($5 USD/month) — required for Cloudflare Sandbox containers. Running the container incurs additional compute costs; see [Container Cost Estimate](#container-cost-estimate) below for details.
- [Anthropic API key](https://console.anthropic.com/) — for Claude access, or you can use AI Gateway's [Unified Billing](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-gateway/features/unified-billing/)

The following Cloudflare features used by this project have free tiers:
- Cloudflare Access (authentication)
- Browser Rendering (for browser navigation)
- AI Gateway (optional, for API routing/analytics)
- R2 Storage (optional, for persistence)

## Container Cost Estimate

This project uses a `standard-1` Cloudflare Container instance (1/2 vCPU, 4 GiB memory, 8 GB disk). Below are approximate monthly costs assuming the container runs 24/7, based on [Cloudflare Containers pricing](https://developers.cloudflare.com/containers/pricing/):

| Resource | Provisioned | Monthly Usage | Included Free | Overage | Approx. Cost |
|----------|-------------|---------------|---------------|---------|--------------|
| Memory | 4 GiB | 2,920 GiB-hrs | 25 GiB-hrs | 2,895 GiB-hrs | ~$26/mo |
| CPU (at ~10% utilization) | 1/2 vCPU | ~2,190 vCPU-min | 375 vCPU-min | ~1,815 vCPU-min | ~$2/mo |
| Disk | 8 GB | 5,840 GB-hrs | 200 GB-hrs | 5,640 GB-hrs | ~$1.50/mo |
| Workers Paid plan | | | | | $5/mo |
| **Total** | | | | | **~$34.50/mo** |

Notes:
- CPU is billed on **active usage only**, not provisioned capacity. The 10% utilization estimate is a rough baseline for a lightly-used personal assistant; your actual cost will vary with usage.
- Memory and disk are billed on **provisioned capacity** for the full time the container is running.
- To reduce costs, configure `SANDBOX_SLEEP_AFTER` (e.g., `10m`) so the container sleeps when idle. A container that only runs 4 hours/day would cost roughly ~$5-6/mo in compute on top of the $5 plan fee.
- Network egress, Workers/Durable Objects requests, and logs are additional but typically minimal for personal use.
- See the [instance types table](https://developers.cloudflare.com/containers/pricing/) for other options (e.g., `lite` at 256 MiB/$0.50/mo memory or `standard-4` at 12 GiB for heavier workloads).

## What is OpenClaw?

[OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw) (formerly Moltbot, formerly Clawdbot) is a personal AI assistant with a gateway architecture that connects to multiple chat platforms. Key features:

- **Control UI** - Web-based chat interface at the gateway
- **Multi-channel support** - Telegram, Discord, Slack
- **Device pairing** - Secure DM authentication requiring explicit approval
- **Persistent conversations** - Chat history and context across sessions
- **Agent runtime** - Extensible AI capabilities with workspace and skills

This project packages OpenClaw to run in a [Cloudflare Sandbox](https://developers.cloudflare.com/sandbox/) container, providing a fully managed, always-on deployment without needing to self-host. Optional R2 storage enables persistence across container restarts.

## Architecture

![moltworker architecture](./assets/architecture.png)

## Quick Start

_Cloudflare Sandboxes are available on the [Workers Paid plan](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/workers/plans)._

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Set your API key (direct Anthropic access)
npx wrangler secret put ANTHROPIC_API_KEY

# Or use Cloudflare AI Gateway instead (see "Optional: Cloudflare AI Gateway" below)
# npx wrangler secret put CLOUDFLARE_AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY
# npx wrangler secret put CF_AI_GATEWAY_ACCOUNT_ID
# npx wrangler secret put CF_AI_GATEWAY_GATEWAY_ID

# Generate and set a gateway token (required for remote access)
# Save this token - you'll need it to access the Control UI
export MOLTBOT_GATEWAY_TOKEN=$(openssl rand -hex 32)
echo "Your gateway token: $MOLTBOT_GATEWAY_TOKEN"
echo "$MOLTBOT_GATEWAY_TOKEN" | npx wrangler secret put MOLTBOT_GATEWAY_TOKEN

# Deploy
npm run deploy
```

After deploying, open the Control UI with your token:

```
https://your-worker.workers.dev/?token=YOUR_GATEWAY_TOKEN
```

Replace `your-worker` with your actual worker subdomain and `YOUR_GATEWAY_TOKEN` with the token you generated above.

**Note:** The first request may take 1-2 minutes while the container starts.

> **Important:** You will not be able to use the Control UI until you complete the following steps. You MUST:
> 1. [Set up Cloudflare Access](#setting-up-the-admin-ui) to protect the admin UI
> 2. [Pair your device](#device-pairing) via the admin UI at `/_admin/`

You'll also likely want to [enable R2 storage](#persistent-storage-r2) so your paired devices and conversation history persist across container restarts (optional but recommended).

## Setting Up the Admin UI

To use the admin UI at `/_admin/` for device management, you need to:
1. Enable Cloudflare Access on your worker
2. Set the Access secrets so the worker can validate JWTs

### 1. Enable Cloudflare Access on workers.dev

The easiest way to protect your worker is using the built-in Cloudflare Access integration for workers.dev:

1. Go to the [Workers & Pages dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/workers-and-pages)
2. Select your Worker (e.g., `moltbot-sandbox`)
3. In **Settings**, under **Domains & Routes**, in the `workers.dev` row, click the meatballs menu (`...`)
4. Click **Enable Cloudflare Access**
5. Copy the values shown in the dialog (you'll need the AUD tag later). **Note:** The "Manage Cloudflare Access" link in the dialog may 404 — ignore it.
6. To configure who can access, go to **Zero Trust** in the Cloudflare dashboard sidebar → **Access** → **Applications**, and find your worker's application:
   - Add your email address to the allow list
   - Or configure other identity providers (Google, GitHub, etc.)
7. Copy the **Application Audience (AUD)** tag from the Access application settings. This will be your `CF_ACCESS_AUD` in Step 2 below

### 2. Set Access Secrets

After enabling Cloudflare Access, set the secrets so the worker can validate JWTs:

```bash
# Your Cloudflare Access team domain (e.g., "myteam.cloudflareaccess.com")
npx wrangler secret put CF_ACCESS_TEAM_DOMAIN

# The Application Audience (AUD) tag from your Access application that you copied in the step above
npx wrangler secret put CF_ACCESS_AUD
```

You can find your team domain in the [Zero Trust Dashboard](https://one.dash.cloudflare.com/) under **Settings** > **Custom Pages** (it's the subdomain before `.cloudflareaccess.com`).

### 3. Redeploy

```bash
npm run deploy
```

Now visit `/_admin/` and you'll be prompted to authenticate via Cloudflare Access before accessing the admin UI.

### Alternative: Manual Access Application

If you prefer more control, you can manually create an Access application:

1. Go to [Cloudflare Zero Trust Dashboard](https://one.dash.cloudflare.com/)
2. Navigate to **Access** > **Applications**
3. Create a new **Self-hosted** application
4. Set the application domain to your Worker URL (e.g., `moltbot-sandbox.your-subdomain.workers.dev`)
5. Add paths to protect: `/_admin/*`, `/api/*`, `/debug/*`
6. Configure your desired identity providers (e.g., email OTP, Google, GitHub)
7. Copy the **Application Audience (AUD)** tag and set the secrets as shown above

### Local Development

For local development, create a `.dev.vars` file with:

```bash
DEV_MODE=true               # Skip Cloudflare Access auth + bypass device pairing
DEBUG_ROUTES=true           # Enable /debug/* routes (optional)
```

## Authentication

By default, moltbot uses **device pairing** for authentication. When a new device (browser, CLI, etc.) connects, it must be approved via the admin UI at `/_admin/`.

### Device Pairing

1. A device connects to the gateway
2. The connection is held pending until approved
3. An admin approves the device via `/_admin/`
4. The device is now paired and can connect freely

This is the most secure option as it requires explicit approval for each device.

### Gateway Token (Required)

A gateway token is required to access the Control UI when hosted remotely. Pass it as a query parameter:

```
https://your-worker.workers.dev/?token=YOUR_TOKEN
wss://your-worker.workers.dev/ws?token=YOUR_TOKEN
```

**Note:** Even with a valid token, new devices still require approval via the admin UI at `/_admin/` (see Device Pairing above).

For local development only, set `DEV_MODE=true` in `.dev.vars` to skip Cloudflare Access authentication and enable `allowInsecureAuth` (bypasses device pairing entirely).

## Persistent Storage (R2)

By default, moltbot data (configs, paired devices, conversation history) is lost when the container restarts. To enable persistent storage across sessions, configure R2:

### 1. Create R2 API Token

1. Go to **R2** > **Overview** in the [Cloudflare Dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/)
2. Click **Manage R2 API Tokens**
3. Create a new token with **Object Read & Write** permissions
4. Select the `moltbot-data` bucket (created automatically on first deploy)
5. Copy the **Access Key ID** and **Secret Access Key**

### 2. Set Secrets

```bash
# R2 Access Key ID
npx wrangler secret put R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID

# R2 Secret Access Key
npx wrangler secret put R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY

# Your Cloudflare Account ID
npx wrangler secret put CF_ACCOUNT_ID
```

To find your Account ID: Go to the [Cloudflare Dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/), click the three dots menu next to your account name, and select "Copy Account ID".

### How It Works

R2 storage uses a backup/restore approach for simplicity:

**On container startup:**
- If R2 is mounted and contains backup data, it's restored to the moltbot config directory
- OpenClaw uses its default paths (no special configuration needed)

**During operation:**
- A cron job runs every 5 minutes to sync the moltbot config to R2
- You can also trigger a manual backup from the admin UI at `/_admin/`

**In the admin UI:**
- When R2 is configured, you'll see "Last backup: [timestamp]"
- Click "Backup Now" to trigger an immediate sync

Without R2 credentials, moltbot still works but uses ephemeral storage (data lost on container restart).

## Container Lifecycle

By default, the sandbox container stays alive indefinitely (`SANDBOX_SLEEP_AFTER=never`). This is recommended because cold starts take 1-2 minutes.

To reduce costs for infrequently used deployments, you can configure the container to sleep after a period of inactivity:

```bash
npx wrangler secret put SANDBOX_SLEEP_AFTER
# Enter: 10m (or 1h, 30m, etc.)
```

When the container sleeps, the next request will trigger a cold start. If you have R2 storage configured, your paired devices and data will persist across restarts.

## Admin UI

![admin ui](./assets/adminui.png)

Access the admin UI at `/_admin/` to:
- **R2 Storage Status** - Shows if R2 is configured, last backup time, and a "Backup Now" button
- **Restart Gateway** - Kill and restart the moltbot gateway process
- **Device Pairing** - View pending requests, approve devices individually or all at once, view paired devices

The admin UI requires Cloudflare Access authentication (or `DEV_MODE=true` for local development).

## Debug Endpoints

Debug endpoints are available at `/debug/*` when enabled (requires `DEBUG_ROUTES=true` and Cloudflare Access):

- `GET /debug/processes` - List all container processes
- `GET /debug/logs?id=<process_id>` - Get logs for a specific process
- `GET /debug/version` - Get container and moltbot version info

## Optional: Chat Channels

### Telegram

```bash
npx wrangler secret put TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN
npm run deploy
```

### Discord

```bash
npx wrangler secret put DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN
npm run deploy
```

### Slack

```bash
npx wrangler secret put SLACK_BOT_TOKEN
npx wrangler secret put SLACK_APP_TOKEN
npm run deploy
```

## Optional: Browser Automation (CDP)

This worker includes a Chrome DevTools Protocol (CDP) shim that enables browser automation capabilities. This allows OpenClaw to control a headless browser for tasks like web scraping, screenshots, and automated testing.

### Setup

1. Set a shared secret for authentication:

```bash
npx wrangler secret put CDP_SECRET
# Enter a secure random string
```

2. Set your worker's public URL:

```bash
npx wrangler secret put WORKER_URL
# Enter: https://your-worker.workers.dev
```

3. Redeploy:

```bash
npm run deploy
```

### Endpoints

| Endpoint | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `GET /cdp/json/version` | Browser version information |
| `GET /cdp/json/list` | List available browser targets |
| `GET /cdp/json/new` | Create a new browser target |
| `WS /cdp/devtools/browser/{id}` | WebSocket connection for CDP commands |

All endpoints require authentication via the `?secret=<CDP_SECRET>` query parameter.

## Built-in Skills

The container includes pre-installed skills in `/root/clawd/skills/`:

### cloudflare-browser

Browser automation via the CDP shim. Requires `CDP_SECRET` and `WORKER_URL` to be set (see [Browser Automation](#optional-browser-automation-cdp) above).

**Scripts:**
- `screenshot.js` - Capture a screenshot of a URL
- `video.js` - Create a video from multiple URLs
- `cdp-client.js` - Reusable CDP client library

**Usage:**
```bash
# Screenshot
node /root/clawd/skills/cloudflare-browser/scripts/screenshot.js https://example.com output.png

# Video from multiple URLs
node /root/clawd/skills/cloudflare-browser/scripts/video.js "https://site1.com,https://site2.com" output.mp4 --scroll
```

See `skills/cloudflare-browser/SKILL.md` for full documentation.

## Optional: Cloudflare AI Gateway

You can route API requests through [Cloudflare AI Gateway](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-gateway/) for caching, rate limiting, analytics, and cost tracking. OpenClaw has native support for Cloudflare AI Gateway as a first-class provider.

AI Gateway acts as a proxy between OpenClaw and your AI provider (e.g., Anthropic). Requests are sent to `https://gateway.ai.cloudflare.com/v1/{account_id}/{gateway_id}/anthropic` instead of directly to `api.anthropic.com`, giving you Cloudflare's analytics, caching, and rate limiting. You still need a provider API key (e.g., your Anthropic API key) — the gateway forwards it to the upstream provider.

### Setup

1. Create an AI Gateway in t

# E2E tests for Moltworker

End-to-end tests that deploy real Moltworker instances to Cloudflare infrastructure.

## Why cloud-based e2e tests?

These tests run against actual Cloudflare infrastructure—the same environment users get when they deploy Moltworker themselves. This catches issues that local testing can't:

- **R2 bucket mounting** only works in production (not with `wrangler dev`)
- **Container cold starts** and sandbox behavior
- **Cloudflare Access** authentication flows
- **Real network latency** and timeout handling

```

### Test flow

1. **Terraform** creates isolated resources: service token + R2 bucket
2. **Wrangler** deploys worker with unique name (timestamp + random suffix)
3. **Access API** creates Access application (must be after worker exists—workers.dev domains require the worker to exist first)
4. **plwr** opens browser with Access headers, navigates to worker
5. **Tests run** with video recording capturing the full UI flow
6. **Teardown** deletes everything: Access app → worker → R2 bucket → service token

### Key design decisions

- **Unique IDs per test run**: `$(date +%s)-$(openssl rand -hex 4)` ensures parallel test runs don't conflict
- **Access created post-deploy**: Terraform can't create Access apps for non-existent domains
- **Container names**: Derived from worker name as `{worker-name}-sandbox`

## Test framework: cctr + plwr

Tests use two complementary tools:

### [cctr](https://github.com/andreasjansson/cctr) - CLI Corpus Test Runner

cctr runs tests where each test case is a command line script, e.g.

```
===
navigate to admin page to approve device
%require
===
TOKEN=$(cat "$CCTR_FIXTURE_DIR/gateway-token.txt")
WORKER_URL=$(cat "$CCTR_FIXTURE_DIR/worker-url.txt")
plwr -S moltworker-e2e open "$WORKER_URL/_admin/?token=$TOKEN"
---
```

Key features:
- **Plain text format**: Easy to read and write
- **`%require` directive**: If this test fails, skip all subsequent tests
- **Variables**: Capture dynamic output with `{{ name }}`
- **Fixtures**: `fixture/` directory copied to temp dir for each suite
- **Setup/teardown**: `_setup.txt` and `_teardown.txt` run before/after tests

### [plwr](https://github.com/andreasjansson/plwr) - Browser automation CLI

plwr provides shell-friendly browser automation with CSS selectors:

```bash
plwr -S test start
plwr -S test open "https://example.com"
plwr -S test wait 'text=Hello'
plwr -S test click 'button:has-text("Submit")'
plwr -S test fill textarea 'Hello world'
plwr -S test video-start
plwr -S test screenshot
plwr -S test stop
```

## Example test

Here's a complete test that approves a device and sends a chat message:

```
===
wait for Approve All button and click it
%require
===
plwr -S moltworker-e2e click 'button:has-text("Approve All")' -T 120000
---

===
wait for approval to complete
%require
===
plwr -S moltworker-e2e wait 'text=No pending pairing requests' -T 120000
---

===
type math question into chat
%require
===
plwr -S moltworker-e2e fill textarea 'What is 847293 + 651824? Reply with just the number.'
---

===
wait for response containing the correct answer
===
plwr -S moltworker-e2e wait 'text=1499117' -T 120000
---
```

## Project Overview

This is a Cloudflare Worker that runs [OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw) (formerly Moltbot/Clawdbot) in a Cloudflare Sandbox container. It provides:
- Proxying to the OpenClaw gateway (web UI + WebSocket)
- Admin UI at `/_admin/` for device management
- API endpoints at `/api/*` for device pairing
- Debug endpoints at `/debug/*` for troubleshooting

**Note:** The CLI tool and npm package are now named `openclaw`. Config files use `.openclaw/openclaw.json`. Legacy `.clawdbot` paths are supported for backward compatibility during transition.

## Key Patterns

### Environment Variables

- `DEV_MODE` - Skips CF Access auth AND bypasses device pairing (maps to `OPENCLAW_DEV_MODE` for container)
- `DEBUG_ROUTES` - Enables `/debug/*` routes (disabled by default)
- See `src/types.ts` for full `MoltbotEnv` interface

### CLI Commands

When calling the OpenClaw CLI from the worker, always include `--url ws://localhost:18789`:
```typescript
sandbox.startProcess('openclaw devices list --json --url ws://localhost:18789')
```

CLI commands take 10-15 seconds due to WebSocket connection overhead. Use `waitForProcess()` helper in `src/routes/api.ts`.

### Success Detection

The CLI outputs "Approved" (capital A). Use case-insensitive checks:
```typescript
stdout.toLowerCase().includes('approved')
```

## Commands

```bash
npm test              # Run tests (vitest)
npm run test:watch    # Run tests in watch mode
npm run build         # Build worker + client
npm run deploy        # Build and deploy to Cloudflare
npm run dev           # Vite dev server
npm run start         # wrangler dev (local worker)
npm run typecheck     # TypeScript check
```

## Testing

Tests use Vitest. Test files are colocated with source files (`*.test.ts`).

Current test coverage:
- `auth/jwt.test.ts` - JWT decoding and validation
- `auth/jwks.test.ts` - JWKS fetching and caching
- `auth/middleware.test.ts` - Auth middleware behavior
- `gateway/env.test.ts` - Environment variable building
- `gateway/process.test.ts` - Process finding logic
- `gateway/r2.test.ts` - R2 mounting logic
- `gateway/sync.test.ts` - R2 backup sync logic

When adding new functionality, add corresponding tests.

## Code Style

- Use TypeScript strict mode
- Prefer explicit types over inference for function signatures
- Keep route handlers thin - extract logic to separate modules
- Use Hono's context methods (`c.json()`, `c.html()`) for responses

## Documentation

- `README.md` - User-facing documentation (setup, configuration, usage)
- `AGENTS.md` - This file, for AI agents

Development documentation goes in AGENTS.md, not README.md.

### Key Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `src/index.ts` | Worker that manages sandbox lifecycle and proxies requests |
| `Dockerfile` | Container image based on `cloudflare/sandbox` with Node 22 + OpenClaw |
| `start-openclaw.sh` | Startup script: R2 restore → onboard → config patch → launch gateway |
| `wrangler.jsonc` | Cloudflare Worker + Container configuration |

## Local Development

```bash
npm install
cp .dev.vars.example .dev.vars
# Edit .dev.vars with your ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
npm run start
```

### Environment Variables

For local development, create `.dev.vars`:

```bash
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
DEV_MODE=true           # Skips CF Access auth + device pairing
DEBUG_ROUTES=true       # Enables /debug/* routes
```

### WebSocket Limitations

Local development with `wrangler dev` has issues proxying WebSocket connections through the sandbox. HTTP requests work but WebSocket connections may fail. Deploy to Cloudflare for full functionality.

## Docker Image Caching

The Dockerfile includes a cache bust comment. When changing `start-openclaw.sh`, bump the version:

```dockerfile
# Build cache bust: 2026-02-06-v28-openclaw-upgrade
```

## Gateway Configuration

OpenClaw configuration is built at container startup:

1. R2 backup is restored if available (with migration from legacy `.clawdbot` paths)
2. If no config exists, `openclaw onboard --non-interactive` creates one based on env vars
3. `start-openclaw.sh` patches the config for channels, gateway auth, and trusted proxies
4. Gateway starts with `openclaw gateway --allow-unconfigured --bind lan`

### AI Provider Priority

The startup script selects the auth choice based on which env vars are set:

1. **Cloudflare AI Gateway** (native): `CLOUDFLARE_AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY` + `CF_AI_GATEWAY_ACCOUNT_ID` + `CF_AI_GATEWAY_GATEWAY_ID`
2. **Direct Anthropic**: `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` (optionally with `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL`)
3. **Direct OpenAI**: `OPENAI_API_KEY`
4. **Legacy AI Gateway**: `AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY` + `AI_GATEWAY_BASE_URL` (routes through Anthropic base URL)

### Container Environment Variables

These are the env vars passed TO the container (internal names):

| Variable | Config Path | Notes |
|----------|-------------|-------|
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | (env var) | OpenClaw reads directly from env |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | (env var) | OpenClaw reads directly from env |
| `CLOUDFLARE_AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY` | (env var) | Native AI Gateway key |
| `CF_AI_GATEWAY_ACCOUNT_ID` | (env var) | Account ID for AI Gateway |
| `CF_AI_GATEWAY_GATEWAY_ID` | (env var) | Gateway ID for AI Gateway |
| `OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_TOKEN` | `--token` flag | Mapped from `MOLTBOT_GATEWAY_TOKEN` |
| `OPENCLAW_DEV_MODE` | `controlUi.allowInsecureAuth` | Mapped from `DEV_MODE` |
| `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` | `channels.telegram.botToken` | |
| `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN` | `channels.discord.token` | |
| `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN` | `channels.slack.botToken` | |
| `SLACK_APP_TOKEN` | `channels.slack.appToken` | |

## OpenClaw Config Schema

OpenClaw has strict config validation. Common gotchas:

- `agents.defaults.model` must be `{ "primary": "model/name" }` not a string
- `gateway.mode` must be `"local"` for headless operation
- No `webchat` channel - the Control UI is served automatically
- `gateway.bind` is not a config option - use `--bind` CLI flag

See [OpenClaw docs](https://docs.openclaw.ai/) for full schema.

## Common Tasks

### Adding a New API Endpoint

1. Add route handler in `src/routes/api.ts`
2. Add types if needed in `src/types.ts`
3. Update client API in `src/client/api.ts` if frontend needs it
4. Add tests

### Adding a New Environment Variable

1. Add to `MoltbotEnv` interface in `src/types.ts`
2. If passed to container, add to `buildEnvVars()` in `src/gateway/env.ts`
3. Update `.dev.vars.example`
4. Document in README.md secrets table

### Debugging

```bash
# View live logs
npx wrangler tail

# Check secrets
npx wrangler secret list
```

Enable debug routes with `DEBUG_ROUTES=true` and check `/debug/processes`.

## R2 Storage Notes

R2 is mounted via s3fs at `/data/moltbot`. Important gotchas:

- **rsync compatibility**: Use `rsync -r --no-times` instead of `rsync -a`. s3fs doesn't support setting timestamps, which causes rsync to fail with "Input/output error".

- **Mount checking**: Don't rely on `sandbox.mountBucket()` error messages to detect "already mounted" state. Instead, check `mount | grep s3fs` to verify the mount status.

- **Never delete R2 data**: The mount directory `/data/moltbot` IS the R2 bucket. Running `rm -rf /data/moltbot/*` will DELETE your backup data. Always check mount status before any destructive operations.

- **Process status**: The sandbox API's `proc.status` may not update immediately after a process completes. Instead of checking `proc.status === 'completed'`, verify success by checking for expected output (e.g., timestamp file exists after sync).

- **R2 prefix migration**: Backups are now stored under `openclaw/` prefix in R2 (was `clawdbot/`). The startup script handles restoring from both old and new prefixes with automatic migration.

```

### File: CONTRIBUTING.md
```md
## Contributing

We welcome contributions, but with a few short rules:

- **Create issues first** for anything non-trivial (typos, doc fixes, glaring errors). Explain why, the impact, and how you intend to solve it _first_, before putting time and energy (or tokens) into a PR.

- **You cannot be offended if we close a PR** or otherwise decide not to merge your work. We're maintaining Moltworker for (many, many) others, and we're ultimately the ones that have to maintain the code. This is especially true if we believe your PR to be AI driven without any human-in-the-loop review or explanation. Not all ideas or work makes it. If it's critical to your workflow, you can fork it!

- **Demonstrate that you've tested your work** - whether via manual testing, automated tests, or a mix of both. You may be quizzed here.

## AI Contributions

> Heavily inspired and influenced by [Ghostty's AI policy](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/blob/main/AI_POLICY.md)

**First**: AI tooling is incredibly powerful, and enabled much of Moltworker itself to exist! But it's a tool: and the wielder of the tool is ultimately responsible for their output.

We have a few rules regarding AI usage:

- **All AI usage in any form must be disclosed.** You must state the tool you used (e.g. Claude Code, Cursor, Amp) along with the extent that the work was AI-assisted.

- **Pull requests created in any way by AI can only be for accepted issues.** Drive-by pull requests that do not reference an accepted issue will be closed. If AI isn't disclosed but a maintainer suspects its use, the PR will be closed. If you want to share code for a non-accepted issue, open a discussion or attach it to an existing discussion.

- **Pull requests created by AI must have been fully verified with human use.** AI must not create hypothetically correct code that hasn't been tested. Importantly, you must not allow AI to write code for platforms or environments you don't have access to manually test on.

- **Issues and discussions can use AI assistance but must have a full human-in-the-loop.** This means that any content generated with AI must have been reviewed _and edited_ by a human before submission. AI is very good at being overly verbose and including noise that distracts from the main point. Humans must do their research and trim this down.

- **No AI-generated media is allowed (art, images, videos, audio, etc.).** Text and code are the only acceptable AI-generated content, per the other rules in this policy.

These rules apply only to outside contributions to Ghostty. Maintainers are exempt from these rules and may use AI tools at their discretion; they've proven themselves trustworthy to apply good judgment.

## There are Humans Here

Please remember that this software is ultimately maintained by humans. 

Every discussion, issue, and pull request is read and reviewed by humans (and sometimes machines, too). It is a boundary point at which people interact with each other and the work done. It is rude and disrespectful to approach this boundary with low-effort, unqualified work, since it puts the burden of validation on the maintainer.

In a perfect world, AI would produce high-quality, accurate work every time. But today, that reality depends on the driver of the AI. And today, most drivers of AI are just not good enough. So, until either the people get better, the AI gets better, or both, we have to have strict rules to protect maintainers.
