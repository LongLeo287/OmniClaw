> **⚡ Quick Start:** Add both Manim skills to your AI agent instantly:
> ```bash
> npx skills add adithya-s-k/manim_skill
> ```

A comprehensive collection of best practices, patterns, and examples for both **Manim Community Edition** and **ManimGL** (3Blue1Brown's version). This repository provides battle-tested code examples and guidelines for creating mathematical animations.

## 📚 About the Two Versions

### Manim Community Edition (`manim`)
- **Repository**: https://github.com/ManimCommunity/manim
- **Focus**: Community-maintained, stable, well-documented
- **Best For**: Production use, educational content, collaborative projects
- **Command**: `manim` CLI
- **Import**: `from manim import *`

### ManimGL (`manimgl`)
- **Repository**: https://github.com/3b1b/manim
- **Focus**: Grant Sanderson's (3Blue1Brown) original version with OpenGL rendering
- **Best For**: Interactive development, 3D scenes, rapid prototyping
- **Command**: `manimgl` CLI
- **Import**: `from manimlib import *`

> **Important**: These are **separate, incompatible** frameworks. Code written for one will not work with the other without modifications.

## 🚀 Installation

### Prerequisites (Both Versions)
1. **Python 3.7+** - Required
2. **FFmpeg** - For video encoding
3. **LaTeX** - For mathematical typesetting (TeX Live, MiKTeX, or MacTeX)

#### Install FFmpeg

**macOS:**
```bash
brew install ffmpeg
```

**Ubuntu/Debian:**
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install ffmpeg
```

**Windows:**
Download from https://ffmpeg.org/download.html and add to PATH

#### Install LaTeX

**macOS:**
```bash
brew install mactex
```

**Ubuntu/Debian:**
```bash
sudo apt install texlive-full
```

**Windows:**
Install MiKTeX from https://miktex.org/download

---

### Installing Manim Community Edition

```bash
# Using pip
pip install manim

# Using uv (recommended for this project)
uv pip install manim

# Verify installation
manim --version
```

**Documentation**: https://docs.manim.community/

---

### Installing ManimGL

```bash
# Using pip
pip install manimgl

# Using uv (recommended for this project)
uv pip install manimgl

# Verify installation
manimgl --version
```

**Additional macOS (ARM) requirement:**
```bash
arch -arm64 brew install pkg-config cairo
```

---

## 🔌 Skills.sh Integration

This repository provides two **AI Agent Skills** that can be installed with a single command using [skills.sh](https://skills.sh/):

### Install with npx (Recommended)

```bash
# Install Manim Community Edition best practices
npx skills add adithya-s-k/manim_skill/skills/manimce-best-practices

# Install ManimGL best practices
npx skills add adithya-s-k/manim_skill/skills/manimgl-best-practices

# Or install both
npx skills add adithya-s-k/manim_skill/skills/manimce-best-practices adithya-s-k/manim_skill/skills/manimgl-best-practices
```

### What are Skills?

Skills are **reusable capabilities for AI coding agents**. Once installed, your AI assistant (like Claude, GitHub Copilot, or Cursor) automatically gains access to:
- ✅ Domain-specific best practices
- ✅ Working code examples
- ✅ Common patterns and anti-patterns
- ✅ Framework-specific knowledge

The skills follow the [Agent Skills open standard](https://github.com/anthropics/skills) and work across multiple AI tools.

### When Skills Activate

**manimce-best-practices** - Automatically loads when:
- You import `from manim import *`
- You use the `manim` CLI command
- You work with Scene classes, mathematical animations, or LaTeX rendering
- You create educational videos or visual explanations with Manim Community

**manimgl-best-practices** - Automatically loads when:
- You import `from manimlib import *`
- You use the `manimgl` CLI command
- You work with InteractiveScene, 3D rendering, or camera frame control
- You use interactive mode with `.embed()` or `checkpoint_paste()`

## 🎯 Quick Start Examples

### Manim Community Edition

```python
from manim import *

class BasicExample(Scene):
    def construct(self):
        circle = Circle()
        circle.set_fill(BLUE, opacity=0.5)
        circle.set_stroke(BLUE_E, width=4)

        self.play(Create(circle))
        self.wait()
```

**Run it:**
```bash
manim -pql scene.py BasicExample
# -p: preview after rendering
# -q: quality (l=low, m=medium, h=high)
```

### ManimGL

```python
from manimlib import *

class BasicExample(InteractiveScene):
    def construct(self):
        circle = Circle()
        circle.set_fill(BLUE, opacity=0.5)
        circle.set_stroke(BLUE_E, width=4)

        self.play(ShowCreation(circle))
        self.wait()
```

**Run it:**
```bash
manimgl scene.py BasicExample --write_file
# --write_file: save video output
# -s: skip to last frame
# -w: write file without opening
```

## 🧪 Running Tests

This repository includes comprehensive tests to ensure all code examples work correctly.

### Test Manim Community Edition Skills

```bash
# Test all files
uv run python tests/manimce/test_all_skills.py

# Test specific file
uv run python tests/manimce/test_all_skills.py animations.md

# Run with multiple workers (faster)
uv run python tests/manimce/test_all_skills.py -j 4
```

### Test ManimGL Skills

```bash
# Test all files
uv run python tests/manimgl/test_all_skills.py

# Test specific file
uv run python tests/manimgl/test_all_skills.py 3d.md

# Run with multiple workers (use caution - can cause OOM)
uv run python tests/manimgl/test_all_skills.py -j 4
```

> **Note**: Parallel testing with many workers can cause out-of-memory errors. Use 4-6 workers max, or test files individually.

## ⚠️ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Command not found: manim/manimgl"**
- Verify installation: `pip list | grep manim`
- Check PATH configuration
- Try: `python -m manim` or `python -m manimlib`

**LaTeX errors**
- Install full LaTeX distribution (not basic)
- ManimCE: Try `manim --tex_template <template>` with different templates
- ManimGL: Check `custom_defaults.yml` for LaTeX configuration

**Video won't play**
- Install media codecs for your OS
- Try different quality settings (`-ql`, `-qm`, `-qh`)
- Check FFmpeg installation: `ffmpeg -version`

**Out of Memory (parallel tests)**
- Reduce worker count: `-j 2` or `-j 4`
- Test files individually
- Close other applications

**Import errors / wrong version**
- Check you're importing the right version:
  - `from manim import *` → Manim Community
  - `from manimlib import *` → ManimGL
- Uninstall conflicting versions: `pip uninstall manim manimgl manimlib`
- Reinstall the version you need

## Adding New Test Suites

When adding tests for other frameworks or skills:

1. Create a new subdirectory (e.g., `tests/manim_gl/`, `tests/other_framework/`)
2. Add test utilities and runner scripts specific to that framework
3. Update this README with the new test suite information

```
