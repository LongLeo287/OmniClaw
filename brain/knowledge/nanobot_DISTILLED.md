    }
  }
}
```

*Set your model* (optionally pin a provider — defaults to auto-detection):
```json
{
  "agents": {
    "defaults": {
      "model": "anthropic/claude-opus-4-5",
      "provider": "openrouter"
    }
  }
}
```

# Contributing to nanobot

Thank you for being here.

nanobot is built with a simple belief: good tools should feel calm, clear, and humane.
We care deeply about useful features, but we also believe in achieving more with less:
solutions should be powerful without becoming heavy, and ambitious without becoming
needlessly complicated.

This guide is not only about how to open a PR. It is also about how we hope to build
software together: with care, clarity, and respect for the next person reading the code.

## Maintainers

| Maintainer | Focus |
|------------|-------|
| [@re-bin](https://github.com/re-bin) | Project lead, `main` branch |
| [@chengyongru](https://github.com/chengyongru) | `nightly` branch, experimental features |

## Branching Strategy

We use a two-branch model to balance stability and exploration:

| Branch | Purpose | Stability |
|--------|---------|-----------|
| `main` | Stable releases | Production-ready |
| `nightly` | Experimental features | May have bugs or breaking changes |

### Which Branch Should I Target?

**Target `nightly` if your PR includes:**

- New features or functionality
- Refactoring that may affect existing behavior
- Changes to APIs or configuration

**Target `main` if your PR includes:**

- Bug fixes with no behavior changes
- Documentation improvements
- Minor tweaks that don't affect functionality

**When in doubt, target `nightly`.** It is easier to move a stable idea from `nightly`
to `main` than to undo a risky change after it lands in the stable branch.

### How Does Nightly Get Merged to Main?

We don't merge the entire `nightly` branch. Instead, stable features are **cherry-picked** from `nightly` into individual PRs targeting `main`:

```
nightly  ──┬── feature A (stable) ──► PR ──► main
           ├── feature B (testing)
           └── feature C (stable) ──► PR ──► main
```

This happens approximately **once a week**, but the timing depends on when features become stable enough.

### Quick Summary

| Your Change | Target Branch |
|-------------|---------------|
| New feature | `nightly` |
| Bug fix | `main` |
| Documentation | `main` |
| Refactoring | `nightly` |
| Unsure | `nightly` |

## Development Setup

Keep setup boring and reliable. The goal is to get you into the code quickly:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/HKUDS/nanobot.git
cd nanobot

# Install with dev dependencies
pip install -e ".[dev]"

# Run tests
pytest

# Lint code
ruff check nanobot/

# Format code
ruff format nanobot/
```

## Code Style

We care about more than passing lint. We want nanobot to stay small, calm, and readable.

When contributing, please aim for code that feels:

- Simple: prefer the smallest change that solves the real problem
- Clear: optimize for the next reader, not for cleverness
- Decoupled: keep boundaries clean and avoid unnecessary new abstractions
- Honest: do not hide complexity, but do not create extra complexity either
- Durable: choose solutions that are easy to maintain, test, and extend

In practice:

- Line length: 100 characters (`ruff`)
- Target: Python 3.11+
- Linting: `ruff` with rules E, F, I, N, W (E501 ignored)
- Async: uses `asyncio` throughout; pytest with `asyncio_mode = "auto"`
- Prefer readable code over magical code
- Prefer focused patches over broad rewrites
- If a new abstraction is introduced, it should clearly reduce complexity rather than move it around

## Questions?

If you have questions, ideas, or half-formed insights, you are warmly welcome here.

Please feel free to open an [issue](https://github.com/HKUDS/nanobot/issues), join the community, or simply reach out:

- [Discord](https://discord.gg/MnCvHqpUGB)
- [Feishu/WeChat](./COMMUNICATION.md)
- Email: Xubin Ren (@Re-bin) — <xubinrencs@gmail.com>

Thank you for spending your time and care on nanobot. We would love for more people to participate in this community, and we genuinely welcome contributions of all sizes.

### File: SECURITY.md
```md
# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in nanobot, please report it by:

1. **DO NOT** open a public GitHub issue
2. Create a private security advisory on GitHub or contact the repository maintainers (xubinrencs@gmail.com)
3. Include:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact
   - Suggested fix (if any)

We aim to respond to security reports within 48 hours.

## Security Best Practices

### 1. API Key Management

**CRITICAL**: Never commit API keys to version control.

```bash
# ✅ Good: Store in config file with restricted permissions
chmod 600 ~/.nanobot/config.json

# ❌ Bad: Hardcoding keys in code or committing them
```

**Recommendations:**
- Store API keys in `~/.nanobot/config.json` with file permissions set to `0600`
- Consider using environment variables for sensitive keys
- Use OS keyring/credential manager for production deployments
- Rotate API keys regularly
- Use separate API keys for development and production

### 2. Channel Access Control

**IMPORTANT**: Always configure `allowFrom` lists for production use.

```json
{
  "channels": {
    "telegram": {
      "enabled": true,
      "token": "YOUR_BOT_TOKEN",
      "allowFrom": ["123456789", "987654321"]
    },
    "whatsapp": {
      "enabled": true,
      "allowFrom": ["+1234567890"]
    }
  }
}
```

**Security Notes:**
- In `v0.1.4.post3` and earlier, an empty `allowFrom` allowed all users. Since `v0.1.4.post4`, empty `allowFrom` denies all access by default — set `["*"]` to explicitly allow everyone.
- Get your Telegram user ID from `@userinfobot`
- Use full phone numbers with country code for WhatsApp
- Review access logs regularly for unauthorized access attempts

### 3. Shell Command Execution

The `exec` tool can execute shell commands. While dangerous command patterns are blocked, you should:

- ✅ Review all tool usage in agent logs
- ✅ Understand what commands the agent is running
- ✅ Use a dedicated user account with limited privileges
- ✅ Never run nanobot as root
- ❌ Don't disable security checks
- ❌ Don't run on systems with sensitive data without careful review

**Blocked patterns:**
- `rm -rf /` - Root filesystem deletion
- Fork bombs
- Filesystem formatting (`mkfs.*`)
- Raw disk writes
- Other destructive operations

### 4. File System Access

File operations have path traversal protection, but:

- ✅ Run nanobot with a dedicated user account
- ✅ Use filesystem permissions to protect sensitive directories
- ✅ Regularly audit file operations in logs
- ❌ Don't give unrestricted access to sensitive files

### 5. Network Security

**API Calls:**
- All external API calls use HTTPS by default
- Timeouts are configured to prevent hanging requests
- Consider using a firewall to restrict outbound connections if needed

**WhatsApp Bridge:**
- The bridge binds to `127.0.0.1:3001` (localhost only, not accessible from external network)
- Set `bridgeToken` in config to enable shared-secret authentication between Python and Node.js
- Keep authentication data in `~/.nanobot/whatsapp-auth` secure (mode 0700)

### 6. Dependency Security

**Critical**: Keep dependencies updated!

```bash
# Check for vulnerable dependencies
pip install pip-audit
pip-audit

# Update to latest secure versions
pip install --upgrade nanobot-ai
```

For Node.js dependencies (WhatsApp bridge):
```bash
cd bridge
npm audit
npm audit fix
```

**Important Notes:**
- Keep `litellm` updated to the latest version for security fixes
- We've updated `ws` to `>=8.17.1` to fix DoS vulnerability
- Run `pip-audit` or `npm audit` regularly
- Subscribe to security advisories for nanobot and its dependencies

### 7. Production Deployment

For production use:

1. **Isolate the Environment**
   ```bash
   # Run in a container or VM
   docker run --rm -it python:3.11
   pip install nanobot-ai
   ```

2. **Use a Dedicated User**
   ```bash
   sudo useradd -m -s /bin/bash nanobot
   sudo -u nanobot nanobot gateway
   ```

3. **Set Proper Permissions**
   ```bash
   chmod 700 ~/.nanobot
   chmod 600 ~/.nanobot/config.json
   chmod 700 ~/.nanobot/whatsapp-auth
   ```

4. **Enable Logging**
   ```bash
   # Configure log monitoring
   tail -f ~/.nanobot/logs/nanobot.log
   ```

5. **Use Rate Limiting**
   - Configure rate limits on your API providers
   - Monitor usage for anomalies
   - Set spending limits on LLM APIs

6. **Regular Updates**
   ```bash
   # Check for updates weekly
   pip install --upgrade nanobot-ai
   ```

### 8. Development vs Production

**Development:**
- Use separate API keys
- Test with non-sensitive data
- Enable verbose logging
- Use a test Telegram bot

**Production:**
- Use dedicated API keys with spending limits
- Restrict file system access
- Enable audit logging
- Regular security reviews
- Monitor for unusual activity

### 9. Data Privacy

- **Logs may contain sensitive information** - secure log files appropriately
- **LLM providers see your prompts** - review their privacy policies
- **Chat history is stored locally** - protect the `~/.nanobot` directory
- **API keys are in plain text** - use OS keyring for production

### 10. Incident Response

If you suspect a security breach:

1. **Immediately revoke compromised API keys**
2. **Review logs for unauthorized access**
   ```bash
   grep "Access denied" ~/.nanobot/logs/nanobot.log
   ```
3. **Check for unexpected file modifications**
4. **Rotate all credentials**
5. **Update to latest version**
6. **Report the incident** to maintainers

## Security Features

### Built-in Security Controls

✅ **Input Validation**
- Path traversal protection on file operations
- Dangerous command pattern detection
- Input length limits on HTTP requests

✅ **Authentication**
- Allow-list based access control — in `v0.1.4.post3` and earlier empty `allowFrom` allowed all; since `v0.1.4.post4` it denies all (`["*"]` explicitly allows all)
- Failed authentication attempt logging

✅ **Resource Protection**
- Command execution timeouts (60s default)
- Output truncation (10KB limit)
- HTTP request timeouts (10-30s)

✅ **Secure Communication**
- HTTPS for all external API calls
- TLS for Telegram API
- WhatsApp bridge: localhost-only binding + optional token auth

## Known Limitations

⚠️ **Current Security Limitations:**

1. **No Rate Limiting** - Users can send unlimited messages (add your own if needed)
2. **Plain Text Config** - API keys stored in plain text (use keyring for production)
3. **No Session Management** - No automatic session expiry
4. **Limited Command Filtering** - Only blocks obvious dangerous patterns
5. **No Audit Trail** - Limited security event logging (enhance as needed)

## Security Checklist

Before deploying nanobot:

- [ ] API keys stored securely (not in code)
- [ ] Config file permissions set to 0600
- [ ] `allowFrom` lists configured for all channels
- [ ] Running as non-root user
- [ ] File system permissions properly restricted
- [ ] Dependencies updated to latest secure versions
- [ ] Logs monitored for security events
- [ ] Rate limits configured on API providers
- [ ] Backup and disaster recovery plan in place
- [ ] Security review of custom skills/tools

### File: docs\CHANNEL_PLUGIN_GUIDE.md

# Channel Plugin Guide

Build a custom nanobot channel in three steps: subclass, package, install.

> **Note:** We recommend developing channel plugins against a source checkout of nanobot (`pip install -e .`) rather than a PyPI release, so you always have access to the latest base-channel features and APIs.

## How It Works

nanobot discovers channel plugins via Python [entry points](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/entry-points/). When `nanobot gateway` starts, it scans:

1. Built-in channels in `nanobot/channels/`
2. External packages registered under the `nanobot.channels` entry point group

If a matching config section has `"enabled": true`, the channel is instantiated and started.

## Quick Start

We'll build a minimal webhook channel that receives messages via HTTP POST and sends replies back.

### Project Structure

```
nanobot-channel-webhook/
├── nanobot_channel_webhook/
│   ├── __init__.py          # re-export WebhookChannel
│   └── channel.py           # channel implementation
└── pyproject.toml
```

### 1. Create Your Channel

```python
# nanobot_channel_webhook/__init__.py
from nanobot_channel_webhook.channel import WebhookChannel

__all__ = ["WebhookChannel"]
```

```python
# nanobot_channel_webhook/channel.py
import asyncio
from typing import Any

from aiohttp import web
from loguru import logger

from nanobot.channels.base import BaseChannel
from nanobot.bus.events import OutboundMessage


class WebhookChannel(BaseChannel):
    name = "webhook"
    display_name = "Webhook"

    @classmethod
    def default_config(cls) -> dict[str, Any]:
        return {"enabled": False, "port": 9000, "allowFrom": []}

    async def start(self) -> None:
        """Start an HTTP server that listens for incoming messages.

        IMPORTANT: start() must block forever (or until stop() is called).
        If it returns, the channel is considered dead.
        """
        self._running = True
        port = self.config.get("port", 9000)

        app = web.Application()
        app.router.add_post("/message", self._on_request)
        runner = web.AppRunner(app)
        await runner.setup()
        site = web.TCPSite(runner, "0.0.0.0", port)
        await site.start()
        logger.info("Webhook listening on :{}", port)

        # Block until stopped
        while self._running:
            await asyncio.sleep(1)

        await runner.cleanup()

    async def stop(self) -> None:
        self._running = False

    async def send(self, msg: OutboundMessage) -> None:
        """Deliver an outbound message.

        msg.content  — markdown text (convert to platform format as needed)
        msg.media    — list of local file paths to attach
        msg.chat_id  — the recipient (same chat_id you passed to _handle_message)
        msg.metadata — may contain "_progress": True for streaming chunks
        """
        logger.info("[webhook] -> {}: {}", msg.chat_id, msg.content[:80])
        # In a real plugin: POST to a callback URL, send via SDK, etc.

    async def _on_request(self, request: web.Request) -> web.Response:
        """Handle an incoming HTTP POST."""
        body = await request.json()
        sender = body.get("sender", "unknown")
        chat_id = body.get("chat_id", sender)
        text = body.get("text", "")
        media = body.get("media", [])       # list of URLs

        # This is the key call: validates allowFrom, then puts the
        # message onto the bus for the agent to process.
        await self._handle_message(
            sender_id=sender,
            chat_id=chat_id,
            content=text,
            media=media,
        )

        return web.json_response({"ok": True})
```

### 2. Register the Entry Point

```toml
# pyproject.toml
[project]
name = "nanobot-channel-webhook"
version = "0.1.0"
dependencies = ["nanobot", "aiohttp"]

[project.entry-points."nanobot.channels"]
webhook = "nanobot_channel_webhook:WebhookChannel"

[build-system]
requires = ["setuptools"]
build-backend = "setuptools.backends._legacy:_Backend"
```

The key (`webhook`) becomes the config section name. The value points to your `BaseChannel` subclass.

### 3. Install & Configure

```bash
pip install -e .
nanobot plugins list      # verify "Webhook" shows as "plugin"
nanobot onboard           # auto-adds default config for detected plugins
```

Edit `~/.nanobot/config.json`:

```json
{
  "channels": {
    "webhook": {
      "enabled": true,
      "port": 9000,
      "allowFrom": ["*"]
    }
  }
}
```

### 4. Run & Test

```bash
nanobot gateway
```

In another terminal:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:9000/message \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"sender": "user1", "chat_id": "user1", "text": "Hello!"}'
```

The agent receives the message and processes it. Replies arrive in your `send()` method.

## BaseChannel API

### Required (abstract)

| Method | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `async start()` | **Must block forever.** Connect to platform, listen for messages, call `_handle_message()` on each. If this returns, the channel is dead. |
| `async stop()` | Set `self._running = False` and clean up. Called when gateway shuts down. |
| `async send(msg: OutboundMessage)` | Deliver an outbound message to the platform. |

### Interactive Login

If your channel requires interactive authentication (e.g. QR code scan), override `login(force=False)`:

```python
async def login(self, force: bool = False) -> bool:
    """
    Perform channel-specific interactive login.

    Args:
        force: If True, ignore existing credentials and re-authenticate.

    Returns True if already authenticated or login succeeds.
    """
    # For QR-code-based login:
    # 1. If force, clear saved credentials
    # 2. Check if already authenticated (load from disk/state)
    # 3. If not, show QR code and poll for confirmation
    # 4. Save token on success
```

Channels that don't need interactive login (e.g. Telegram with bot token, Discord with bot token) inherit the default `login()` which just returns `True`.

Users trigger interactive login via:
```bash
nanobot channels login <channel_name>
nanobot channels login <channel_name> --force  # re-authenticate
```

### Provided by Base

| Method / Property | Description |
|-------------------|-------------|
| `_handle_message(sender_id, chat_id, content, media?, metadata?, session_key?)` | **Call this when you receive a message.** Checks `is_allowed()`, then publishes to the bus. Automatically sets `_wants_stream` if `supports_streaming` is true. |
| `is_allowed(sender_id)` | Checks against `config["allowFrom"]`; `"*"` allows all, `[]` denies all. |
| `default_config()` (classmethod) | Returns default config dict for `nanobot onboard`. Override to declare your fields. |
| `transcribe_audio(file_path)` | Transcribes audio via Groq Whisper (if configured). |
| `supports_streaming` (property) | `True` when config has `"streaming": true` **and** subclass overrides `send_delta()`. |
| `is_running` | Returns `self._running`. |
| `login(force=False)` | Perform interactive login (e.g. QR code scan). Returns `True` if already authenticated or login succeeds. Override in subclasses that support interactive login. |

### Optional (streaming)

| Method | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `async send_delta(chat_id, delta, metadata?)` | Override to receive streaming chunks. See [Streaming Support](#streaming-support) for details. |

### Message Types

```python
@dataclass
class OutboundMessage:
    channel: str        # your channel name
    chat_id: str        # recipient (same value you passed to _handle_message)
    content: str        # markdown text — convert to platform format as needed
    media: list[str]    # local file paths to attach (images, audio, docs)
    metadata: dict      # may contain: "_progress" (bool) for streaming chunks,
                        #              "message_id" for reply threading
```

## Streaming Support

Channels can opt into real-time streaming — the agent sends content token-by-token instead of one final message. This is entirely optional; channels work fine without it.

### How It Works

When **both** conditions are met, the agent streams content through your channel:

1. Config has `"streaming": true`
2. Your subclass overrides `send_delta()`

If either is missing, the agent falls back to the normal one-shot `send()` path.

### Implementing `send_delta`

Override `send_delta` to handle two types of calls:

```python
async def send_delta(self, chat_id: str, delta: str, metadata: dict[str, Any] | None = None) -> None:
    meta = metadata or {}

    if meta.get("_stream_end"):
        # Streaming finished — do final formatting, cleanup, etc.
        return

    # Regular delta — append text, update the message on screen
    # delta contains a small chunk of text (a few tokens)
```

**Metadata flags:**

| Flag | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| `_stream_delta: True` | A content chunk (delta contains the new text) |
| `_stream_end: True` | Streaming finished (delta is empty) |
| `_resuming: True` | More streaming rounds coming (e.g. tool call then another response) |

### Example: Webhook with Streaming

```python
class WebhookChannel(BaseChannel):
    name = "webhook"
    display_name = "Webhook"

    def __init__(self, config, bus):
        super().__init__(config, bus)
        self._buffers: dict[str, str] = {}

    async def send_delta(self, chat_id: str, delta: str, metadata: dict[str, Any] | None = None) -> None:
        meta = metadata or {}
        if meta.get("_stream_end"):
            text = self._buffers.pop(chat_id, "")
            # Final delivery — format and send the complete message
            await self._deliver(chat_id, text, final=True)
            return

        self._buffers.setdefault(chat_id, "")
        self._buffers[chat_id] += delta
        # Incremental update — push partial text to the client
        await self._deliver(chat_id, self._buffers[chat_id], final=False)

    async def send(self, msg: OutboundMessage) -> None:
        # Non-streaming path — unchanged
        await self._deliver(msg.chat_id, msg.content, final=True)
```

### Config

Enable streaming per channel:

```json
{
  "channels": {
    "webhook": {
      "enabled": true,
      "streaming": true,
      "allowFrom": ["*"]
    }
  }
}
```

When `streaming` is `false` (default) or omitted, only `send()` is called — no streaming overhead.

### BaseChannel Streaming API

| Method / Property | Description |
|-------------------|-------------|
| `async send_delta(chat_id, delta, metadata?)` | Override to handle streaming chunks. No-op by default. |
| `supports_streaming` (property) | Returns `True` when config has `streaming: true` **and** subclass overrides `send_delta`. |

## Config

Your channel receives config as a plain `dict`. Access fields with `.get()`:

```python
async def start(self) -> None:
    port = self.config.get("port", 9000)
    token = self.config.get("token", "")
```

`allowFrom` is handled automatically by `_handle_message()` — you don't need to check it yourself.

Override `default_config()` so `nanobot onboard` auto-populates `config.json`:

```python
@classmethod
def default_config(cls) -> dict[str, Any]:
    return {"enabled": False, "port": 9000, "allowFrom": []}
```

If not overridden, the base class returns `{"enabled": false}`.

## Naming Convention

| What | Format | Example |
|------|--------|---------|
| PyPI package | `nanobot-channel-{name}` | `nanobot-channel-webhook` |
| Entry point key | `{name}` | `webhook` |
| Config section | `channels.{name}` | `channels.webhook` |
| Python package | `nanobot_channel_{name}` | `nanobot_channel_webhook` |

## Local Development

```bash
git clone https://github.com/you/nanobot-channel-webhook
cd nanobot-channel-webhook
pip install -e .
nanobot plugins list    # should show "Webhook" as "plugin"
nanobot gateway         # test end-to-end
```

## Verify

```bash
$ nanobot plugins list

  Name       Source    Enabled
  telegram   builtin  yes
  discord    builtin  no
  webhook    plugin   yes
```

```

### File: docs\PYTHON_SDK.md
```md
# Python SDK

Use nanobot programmatically — load config, run the agent, get results.

## Quick Start

```python
import asyncio
from nanobot import Nanobot

async def main():
    bot = Nanobot.from_config()
    result = await bot.run("What time is it in Tokyo?")
    print(result.content)

asyncio.run(main())
```

## API

### `Nanobot.from_config(config_path?, *, workspace?)`

Create a `Nanobot` from a config file.

| Param | Type | Default | Description |
|-------|------|---------|-------------|
| `config_path` | `str \| Path \| None` | `None` | Path to `config.json`. Defaults to `~/.nanobot/config.json`. |
| `workspace` | `str \| Path \| None` | `None` | Override workspace directory from config. |

Raises `FileNotFoundError` if an explicit path doesn't exist.

### `await bot.run(message, *, session_key?, hooks?)`

Run the agent once. Returns a `RunResult`.

| Param | Type | Default | Description |
|-------|------|---------|-------------|
| `message` | `str` | *(required)* | The user message to process. |
| `session_key` | `str` | `"sdk:default"` | Session identifier for conversation isolation. Different keys get independent history. |
| `hooks` | `list[AgentHook] \| None` | `None` | Lifecycle hooks for this run only. |

```python
# Isolated sessions — each user gets independent conversation history
await bot.run("hi", session_key="user-alice")
await bot.run("hi", session_key="user-bob")
```

### `RunResult`

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `content` | `str` | The agent's final text response. |
| `tools_used` | `list[str]` | Tool names invoked during the run. |
| `messages` | `list[dict]` | Raw message history (for debugging). |

## Hooks

Hooks let you observe or modify the agent loop without touching internals.

Subclass `AgentHook` and override any method:

| Method | When |
|--------|------|
| `before_iteration(ctx)` | Before each LLM call |
| `on_stream(ctx, delta)` | On each streamed token |
| `on_stream_end(ctx)` | When streaming finishes |
| `before_execute_tools(ctx)` | Before tool execution (inspect `ctx.tool_calls`) |
| `after_iteration(ctx, response)` | After each LLM response |
| `finalize_content(ctx, content)` | Transform final output text |

### Example: Audit Hook

```python
from nanobot.agent import AgentHook, AgentHookContext

class AuditHook(AgentHook):
    def __init__(self):
        self.calls = []

    async def before_execute_tools(self, ctx: AgentHookContext) -> None:
        for tc in ctx.tool_calls:
            self.calls.append(tc.name)
            print(f"[audit] {tc.name}({tc.arguments})")

hook = AuditHook()
result = await bot.run("List files in /tmp", hooks=[hook])
print(f"Tools used: {hook.calls}")
```

### Composing Hooks

Pass multiple hooks — they run in order, errors in one don't block others:

```python
result = await bot.run("hi", hooks=[AuditHook(), MetricsHook()])
```

Under the hood this uses `CompositeHook` for fan-out with error isolation.

### `finalize_content` Pipeline

Unlike the async methods (fan-out), `finalize_content` is a pipeline — each hook's output feeds the next:

```python
class Censor(AgentHook):
    def finalize_content(self, ctx, content):
        return content.replace("secret", "***") if content else content
```

## Full Example

```python
import asyncio
from nanobot import Nanobot
from nanobot.agent import AgentHook, AgentHookContext

class TimingHook(AgentHook):
    async def before_iteration(self, ctx: AgentHookContext) -> None:
        import time
        ctx.metadata["_t0"] = time.time()

    async def after_iteration(self, ctx, response) -> None:
        import time
        elapsed = time.time() - ctx.metadata.get("_t0", 0)
        print(f"[timing] iteration took {elapsed:.2f}s")

async def main():
    bot = Nanobot.from_config(workspace="/my/project")
    result = await bot.run(
        "Explain the main function",
        hooks=[TimingHook()],
    )
    print(result.content)

asyncio.run(main())
```

```
