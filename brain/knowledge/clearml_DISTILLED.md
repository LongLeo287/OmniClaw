#### [Start using ClearML](https://clear.ml/docs/latest/docs/getting_started/ds/ds_first_steps) 


1. Sign up for free to the [ClearML Hosted Service](https://app.clear.ml) (alternatively, you can set up your own server, see [here](https://clear.ml/docs/latest/docs/deploying_clearml/clearml_server)).

    > **_ClearML Demo Server:_** ClearML no longer uses the demo server by default. To enable the demo server, set the `CLEARML_NO_DEFAULT_SERVER=0`
    > environment variable. Credentials aren't needed, but experiments launched to the demo server are public, so make sure not 
    > to launch sensitive experiments if using the demo server.

1. Install the `clearml` python package:

    ```bash
    pip install clearml
    ```

1. Connect the ClearML SDK to the server by [creating credentials](https://app.clear.ml/settings/workspace-configuration), then execute the command
below and follow the instructions: 

    ```bash
    clearml-init
    ```

1. Add two lines to your code:
    ```python
    from clearml import Task
    task = Task.init(project_name='examples', task_name='hello world')
    ```

And you are done! Everything your process outputs is now automagically logged into ClearML.

Next step, automation! **Learn more about ClearML's two-click automation [here](https://clear.ml/docs/latest/docs/getting_started/mlops/mlops_first_steps)**. 

## ClearML Architecture

The ClearML run-time components:

* The ClearML Python Package - for integrating ClearML into your existing scripts by adding just two lines of code, and optionally extending your experiments and other workflows with ClearML's powerful and versatile set of classes and methods.
* The ClearML Server - for storing experiment, model, and workflow data; supporting the Web UI experiment manager and MLOps automation for reproducibility and tuning. It is available as a hosted service and open source for you to deploy your own ClearML Server.
* The ClearML Agent - for MLOps orchestration, experiment and workflow reproducibility, and scalability.

## Why ClearML?

ClearML is our solution to a problem we share with countless other researchers and developers in the machine
learning/deep learning universe: Training production-grade deep learning models is a glorious but messy process.
ClearML tracks and controls the process by associating code version control, research projects,
performance metrics, and model provenance.

We designed ClearML specifically to require effortless integration so that teams can preserve their existing methods
and practices. 

  - Use it on a daily basis to boost collaboration and visibility in your team 
  - Create a remote job from any experiment with a click of a button
  - Automate processes and create pipelines to collect your experimentation logs, outputs, and data
  - Store all your data on any object-storage solution, with the most straightforward interface possible
  - Make your data transparent by cataloging it all on the ClearML platform

We believe ClearML is ground-breaking. We wish to establish new standards of true seamless integration between
experiment management, MLOps, and data management.

## Who We Are

ClearML is supported by you and the [clear.ml](https://clear.ml) team, which helps enterprise companies build scalable MLOps. 

We built ClearML to track and control the glorious but messy process of training production-grade deep learning models.
We are committed to vigorously supporting and expanding the capabilities of ClearML.

We promise to always be backwardly compatible, making sure all your logs, data, and pipelines will always upgrade with you.

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to ClearML.
These are primarily guidelines, not rules.
Use your best judgment and feel free to propose changes to this document in a pull request.

## Reporting Issues

By following these guidelines, you help maintainers and the community understand your report, reproduce the behavior, and find related reports.

Before reporting an issue, please check whether it already appears [here](https://github.com/allegroai/clearml/issues).
If it does, join the on-going discussion instead.

**Note**: If you find a **Closed** issue that may be the same issue which you are currently experiencing,
then open a **New** issue and include a link to the original (Closed) issue in the body of your new one.

When reporting an issue, please include as much detail as possible: explain the problem and include additional details to help maintainers reproduce the problem:

* **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the problem.
* **Describe the exact steps necessary to reproduce the problem** in as much detail as possible. Please do not just summarize what you did. Make sure to explain how you did it.
* **Provide the specific environment setup.** Include the `pip freeze` output, specific environment variables, Python version, and other relevant information.
* **Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps.** Include links to files or GitHub projects, or copy/paste snippets which you use in those examples.
* **If you are reporting any  ClearML crash,** include a crash report with a stack trace from the operating system. Make sure to add the crash report in the issue and place it in a [code block](https://help.github.com/en/articles/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github#multiple-lines),
a [file attachment](https://help.github.com/articles/file-attachments-on-issues-and-pull-requests/), or just put it in a [gist](https://gist.github.com/) (and provide link to that gist).
* **Describe the behavior you observed after following the steps** and the exact problem with that behavior.
* **Explain which behavior you expected to see and why.**
* **For Web-App issues, please include screenshots and animated GIFs** which recreate the described steps and clearly demonstrate the problem. You can use [LICEcap](https://www.cockos.com/licecap/) to record GIFs on macOS and Windows, and [silentcast](https://github.com/colinkeenan/silentcast) or [byzanz](https://github.com/threedaymonk/byzanz) on Linux.

## Suggesting New Features and Enhancements

By following these guidelines, you help maintainers and the community understand your suggestion and find related suggestions.

Enhancement suggestions are tracked as GitHub issues. After you determine which repository your enhancement suggestion is related to, create an issue on that repository and provide the following:

* **A clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the suggestion.

# Handling the Google Cloud Storage breaking change

## Rationale

Due to an issue with ClearML SDK versions 1.11.x, URLs of objects uploaded to the Google Cloud Storage were stored in the ClearML backend as a quoted string. This behavior causes issues accessing registered objects using the ClearML SDK. The issue affects the URLs of models, datasets, artifacts, and media files/debug samples. In case you have such objects uploaded with the affected ClearML SDK versions and wish to be able to access them programmatically using the ClearML SDK using version 1.12 and above (note that access from the ClearML UI is still possible), you should perform the actions listed in the section below.

## Recommended Steps

The code snippets below should serve as an example rather than an actual conversion script.

The general flow is that you will first need to download these files by a custom access method, then upload them with the fixed SDK version. Depending on what object you're trying to fix, you should pick the respective lines of code from steps 1 and 2.



1. You need to be able to download objects (models, datasets, media, artifacts) registered by affected versions. See the code snippet below and adjust it according to your use case to be able to get a local copy of the object
```python
from clearml import Task, ImportModel
from urllib.parse import unquote # <- you will need this


ds_task = Task.get_task(dataset_id) # For Datasets
# OR
task = Task.get_task(task_id) # For Artifacts, Media, and Models


url = unquote(ds_task.artifacts['data'].url) # For Datasets
# OR
url = unquote(task.artifacts[artifact_name].url) # For Artifacts
# OR
model = InputModel(task.output_models_id['test_file']) # For Models associated to tasks
url = unquote(model.url)
# OR 
model = InputModel(model_id) # For any Models
url = unquote(model.url)
# OR
samples = task.get_debug_samples(title, series) # For Media/Debug samples
sample_urls = [unquote(sample['url']) for sample in samples]

local_path = StorageManager.get_local_copy(url)

# NOTE: For Datasets you will need to unzip the `local_path`
```

2. Once the object is downloaded locally, you can re-register it with the new version. See the snipped below and adjust according to your use case
```python
from clearml import Task, Dataset, OutputModel
import os


ds = Dataset.create(dataset_name=task.name, dataset_projecte=task.get_project_name(), parents=[Dataset.get(dataset_id)]) # For Datasets
# OR
task = Task.get_task(task_name=task.name, project_name=task.get_project_name()) # For Artifacts, Media, and Models


ds.add_files(unzipped_local_path) # For Datasets
ds.finalize(auto_upload=True)
# OR
task.upload_artifact(name=artifact_name, artifact_object=local_path) # For Artifacts
# OR
model = OutputModel(task=task) # For any Models
model.update_weights(local_path) # note: if the original model was created with update_weights_package,
                                 # preserve this behavior by saving the new one with update_weights_package too
# OR
for sample in samples:
   task.get_logger().report_media(sample['metric'], sample['variant'], local_path=unquote(sample['url'])) # For Media/Debug samples
```

## Alternative methods

The methods described next are more advanced (read "more likely to mess up"). If you're unsure whether to use them or not, better don't. Both methods described below will alter (i.e., modify **in-place**) the existing objects. Note that you still need to run the code from step 1 to have access to all required metadata.

**Method 1**: You can try to alter the existing unpublished experiments/models using the lower-level `APIClient`
```python
from clearml.backend_api.session.client import APIClient


client = APIClient()

client.tasks.add_or_update_artifacts(task=ds_task.id, force=True, artifacts=[{"uri": unquote(ds_task.artifacts['state'].url), "key": "state", "type": "dict"}])
client.tasks.add_or_update_artifacts(task=ds_task.id, force=True, artifacts=[{"uri": unquote(ds_task.artifacts['data'].url), "key": "data", "type": "custom"}]) # For datasets on completed dataset uploads
# OR
client.tasks.add_or_update_artifacts(task=task.id, force=True, artifacts=[{"uri": unquote(url), "key": artifact_name, "type": "custom"}]) # For artifacts on completed tasks
# OR
client.models.edit(model=model.id, force=True, uri=url) # For any unpublished Model
```

**Method 2**: There's an option available only to those who self-host their ClearML server. It is possible to manually update the values registered in MongoDB, but beware - this advanced procedure should be performed with extreme care, as it can lead to an inconsistent state if mishandled.
