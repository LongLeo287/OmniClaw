## Why This Exists

Building a game solo with AI is powerful — but a single chat session has no structure. No one stops you from hardcoding magic numbers, skipping design docs, or writing spaghetti code. There's no QA pass, no design review, no one asking "does this actually fit the game's vision?"

**Claude Code Game Studios** solves this by giving your AI session the structure of a real studio. Instead of one general-purpose assistant, you get 48 specialized agents organized into a studio hierarchy — directors who guard the vision, department leads who own their domains, and specialists who do the hands-on work. Each agent has defined responsibilities, escalation paths, and quality gates.

The result: you still make every decision, but now you have a team that asks the right questions, catches mistakes early, and keeps your project organized from first brainstorm to launch.

## Studio Hierarchy

Agents are organized into three tiers, matching how real studios operate:

```
Tier 1 — Directors (Opus)
  creative-director    technical-director    producer

Tier 2 — Department Leads (Sonnet)
  game-designer        lead-programmer       art-director
  audio-director       narrative-director    qa-lead
  release-manager      localization-lead

**Team Orchestration** (coordinate multiple agents on a single feature)
`/team-combat` `/team-narrative` `/team-ui` `/team-release` `/team-polish` `/team-audio` `/team-level`

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) (`npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code`)
- **Recommended**: [jq](https://jqlang.github.io/jq/) (for hook validation) and Python 3 (for JSON validation)

All hooks fail gracefully if optional tools are missing — nothing breaks, you just lose validation.

### Setup

1. **Clone or use as template**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Donchitos/Claude-Code-Game-Studios.git my-game
   cd my-game
   ```

2. **Open Claude Code** and start a session:
   ```bash
   claude
   ```

3. **Run `/start`** — the system asks where you are (no idea, vague concept,
   clear design, existing work) and guides you to the right workflow. No assumptions.

   Or jump directly to a specific skill if you already know what you need:
   - `/brainstorm` — explore game ideas from scratch
   - `/setup-engine godot 4.6` — configure your engine if you already know
   - `/project-stage-detect` — analyze an existing project

## Upgrading

Already using an older version of this template? See [UPGRADING.md](UPGRADING.md)
for step-by-step migration instructions, a breakdown of what changed between
versions, and which files are safe to overwrite vs. which need a manual merge.

```

## How It Works

### Agent Coordination

Agents follow a structured delegation model:

1. **Vertical delegation** — directors delegate to leads, leads delegate to specialists
2. **Horizontal consultation** — same-tier agents can consult each other but can't make binding cross-domain decisions
3. **Conflict resolution** — disagreements escalate up to the shared parent (`creative-director` for design, `technical-director` for technical)
4. **Change propagation** — cross-department changes are coordinated by `producer`
5. **Domain boundaries** — agents don't modify files outside their domain without explicit delegation

### Collaborative, Not Autonomous

This is **not** an auto-pilot system. Every agent follows a strict collaboration protocol:

1. **Ask** — agents ask questions before proposing solutions
2. **Present options** — agents show 2-4 options with pros/cons
3. **You decide** — the user always makes the call
4. **Draft** — agents show work before finalizing
5. **Approve** — nothing gets written without your sign-off

You stay in control. The agents provide structure and expertise, not autonomy.

### Automated Safety

**Hooks** run automatically on every session:

| Hook | Trigger | What It Does |
|------|---------|--------------|
| `validate-commit.sh` | `git commit` | Checks for hardcoded values, TODO format, JSON validity, design doc sections |
| `validate-push.sh` | `git push` | Warns on pushes to protected branches |
| `validate-assets.sh` | File writes in `assets/` | Validates naming conventions and JSON structure |
| `session-start.sh` | Session open | Loads sprint context and recent git activity |
| `detect-gaps.sh` | Session open | Detects fresh projects (suggests `/start`) and missing documentation when code/prototypes exist |
| `pre-compact.sh` | Context compression | Preserves session progress notes |
| `session-stop.sh` | Session close | Logs accomplishments |
| `log-agent.sh` | Agent spawned | Audit trail of all subagent invocations |

**Permission rules** in `settings.json` auto-allow safe operations (git status, test runs) and block dangerous ones (force push, `rm -rf`, reading `.env` files).

### Path-Scoped Rules

Coding standards are automatically enforced based on file location:

| Path | Enforces |
|------|----------|
| `src/gameplay/**` | Data-driven values, delta time usage, no UI references |
| `src/core/**` | Zero allocations in hot paths, thread safety, API stability |
| `src/ai/**` | Performance budgets, debuggability, data-driven parameters |
| `src/networking/**` | Server-authoritative, versioned messages, security |
| `src/ui/**` | No game state ownership, localization-ready, accessibility |
| `design/gdd/**` | Required 8 sections, formula format, edge cases |
| `tests/**` | Test naming, coverage requirements, fixture patterns |
| `prototypes/**` | Relaxed standards, README required, hypothesis documented |

## Design Philosophy

This template is grounded in professional game development practices:

- **MDA Framework** — Mechanics, Dynamics, Aesthetics analysis for game design
- **Self-Determination Theory** — Autonomy, Competence, Relatedness for player motivation
- **Flow State Design** — Challenge-skill balance for player engagement
- **Bartle Player Types** — Audience targeting and validation
- **Verification-Driven Development** — Tests first, then implementation

## Customization

This is a **template**, not a locked framework. Everything is meant to be customized:

- **Add/remove agents** — delete agent files you don't need, add new ones for your domains
- **Edit agent prompts** — tune agent behavior, add project-specific knowledge
- **Modify skills** — adjust workflows to match your team's process
- **Add rules** — create new path-scoped rules for your project's directory structure
- **Tune hooks** — adjust validation strictness, add new checks
- **Pick your engine** — use the Godot, Unity, or Unreal agent set (or none)

## Platform Support

Tested on **Windows 10** with Git Bash. All hooks use POSIX-compatible patterns (`grep -E`, not `grep -P`) and include fallbacks for missing tools. Works on macOS and Linux without modification.

## Community

# Engine Reference Documentation

This directory contains curated, version-pinned documentation snapshots for the
game engine(s) used in this project. These files exist because **LLM knowledge
has a cutoff date** and game engines update frequently.

## Why This Exists

Claude's training data has a knowledge cutoff (currently May 2025). Game engines
like Godot, Unity, and Unreal ship updates that introduce breaking API changes,
new features, and deprecated patterns. Without these reference files, agents will
suggest outdated code.

## Structure

Each engine gets its own directory:

```
<engine>/
├── VERSION.md              # Pinned version, verification date, knowledge gap window
├── breaking-changes.md     # API changes between versions, organized by risk level
├── deprecated-apis.md      # "Don't use X → Use Y" lookup tables
├── current-best-practices.md  # New practices not in model training data
└── modules/                # Per-subsystem quick references (~150 lines max each)
    ├── rendering.md
    ├── physics.md
    └── ...
```

## How Agents Use These Files

Engine-specialist agents are instructed to:

1. Read `VERSION.md` to confirm the current engine version
2. Check `deprecated-apis.md` before suggesting any engine API
3. Consult `breaking-changes.md` for version-specific concerns
4. Read relevant `modules/*.md` for subsystem-specific work

## Maintenance

### When to Update

- After upgrading the engine version
- When the LLM model is updated (new knowledge cutoff)
- After running `/refresh-docs` (if available)
- When you discover an API the model gets wrong

### How to Update

1. Update `VERSION.md` with the new engine version and date
2. Add new entries to `breaking-changes.md` for the version transition
3. Move newly deprecated APIs into `deprecated-apis.md`
4. Update `current-best-practices.md` with new patterns
5. Update relevant `modules/*.md` with API changes
6. Set "Last verified" dates on all modified files

### Quality Rules

- Every file must have a "Last verified: YYYY-MM-DD" date
- Keep module files under 150 lines (context budget)
- Include code examples showing correct/incorrect patterns
- Link to official documentation URLs for verification
- Only document things that differ from the model's training data

```

# Collaborative Session Examples

This directory contains realistic, end-to-end session transcripts showing how the Game Studio Agent Architecture works in practice. Each example demonstrates the **collaborative workflow** where agents ask questions, present options, and wait for user approval rather than autonomously generating content.

---

## 📚 **Available Examples**

### [Session: Designing the Crafting System](session-design-crafting-system.md)
**Type:** Design
**Agent:** game-designer
**Duration:** ~45 minutes (12 turns)
**Complexity:** Medium

**Scenario:**
Solo dev needs to design a crafting system that serves Pillar 2 ("Emergent Discovery Through Experimentation"). The agent guides them through question/answer, presents 3 design options with game theory analysis, incorporates user modifications, and iteratively drafts the GDD with approval at each step.

**Key Collaborative Moments:**
- Agent asks 5 clarifying questions upfront
- Presents 3 distinct options with pros/cons + MDA alignment
- User modifies recommended option, agent incorporates immediately
- Edge case flagged proactively ("what if non-recipe combo?")
- Each GDD section shown for approval before moving to next
- Explicit "May I write to [file]?" before creating file

**Learn:**
- How design agents ask about goals, constraints, references
- How to present options using game design theory (MDA, SDT, Bartle)
- How to iterate on drafts section-by-section
- When to delegate to specialists (systems-designer, economy-designer)

---

### [Session: Implementing Combat Damage Calculation](session-implement-combat-damage.md)
**Type:** Implementation
**Agent:** gameplay-programmer
**Duration:** ~30 minutes (10 turns)
**Complexity:** Low-Medium

**Scenario:**
User has a complete design doc and wants the damage calculation implemented. Agent reads the spec, identifies 7 ambiguities/gaps, asks clarifying questions, proposes architecture for approval, implements with rule enforcement, and proactively writes tests.

**Key Collaborative Moments:**
- Agent reads design doc first, identifies 7 spec ambiguities
- Architecture proposed with code samples BEFORE implementation
- User requests type safety, agent refines and re-proposes
- Rules catch issues (hardcoded values), agent fixes transparently
- Tests written proactively following verification-driven development
- Agent offers options for next steps rather than assuming

**Learn:**
- How implementation agents clarify specs before coding
- How to propose architecture with code samples for approval
- How rules enforce standards automatically
- How to handle spec gaps (ask, don't assume)
- Verification-driven development (tests prove it works)

---

### [Session: Scope Crisis - Strategic Decision Making](session-scope-crisis-decision.md)
**Type:** Strategic Decision
**Agent:** creative-director
**Duration:** ~25 minutes (8 turns)
**Complexity:** High

**Scenario:**
Solo dev faces crisis: Alpha milestone in 2 weeks, crafting system needs 3 weeks, investor demo is make-or-break. Creative director gathers context, frames the decision, presents 3 strategic options with honest trade-off analysis, makes recommendation but defers to user, then documents decision with ADR and demo script.

**Key Collaborative Moments:**
- Agent reads context docs before proposing solutions
- Asks 5 questions to understand decision constraints
- Frames decision properly (what's at stake, evaluation criteria)
- Presents 3 options with risk analysis and historical precedent
- Makes strong recommendation but explicitly: "this is your call"
- Documents decision + provides demo script to support user

**Learn:**
- How leadership agents frame strategic decisions
- How to present options with trade-off analysis
- How to use game dev precedent and theory in recommendations
- How to document decisions (ADRs)
- How to cascade decisions to affected departments

---

## 🎯 **What These Examples Demonstrate**

All examples follow the **collaborative workflow pattern:**

```
Question → Options → Decision → Draft → Approval
```

> **Note:** These examples show the collaborative pattern as conversational text.
> In practice, agents now use the `AskUserQuestion` tool at decision points to
> present structured option pickers (with labels, descriptions, and multi-select).
> The pattern is **Explain → Capture**: agents explain their analysis in
> conversation first, then present a structured UI picker for the user's decision.

### ✅ **Collaborative Behaviors Shown:**

1. **Agents Ask Before Assuming**
   - Design agents ask about goals, constraints, references
   - Implementation agents clarify spec ambiguities
   - Leadership agents gather full context before recommending

2. **Agents Present Options, Not Dictates**
   - 2-4 options with pros/cons
   - Reasoning based on theory, precedent, project pillars
   - Recommendation made, but user decides

3. **Agents Show Work Before Finalizing**
   - Design drafts shown section-by-section
   - Architecture proposals shown before implementation
   - Strategic analysis presented before decisions

4. **Agents Get Approval Before Writing Files**
   - Explicit "May I write to [file]?" before using Write/Edit tools
   - Multi-file changes list all affected files first
   - User says "Yes" before any file is created

5. **Agents Iterate on Feedback**
   - User modifications incorporated immediately
   - No defensiveness when user changes recommendations
   - Celebrate when user improves agent's suggestion

---

## 📖 **How to Use These Examples**

### For New Users:
Read these examples BEFORE your first session. They show realistic expectations for how agents work:
- Agents are consultants, not autonomous executors
- You make all creative/strategic decisions
- Agents provide expert guidance and options

### For Understanding Specific Workflows:
- **Designing a system?** → Read session-design-crafting-system.md
- **Implementing code?** → Read session-implement-combat-damage.md
- **Making strategic decisions?** → Read session-scope-crisis-decision.md

### For Training:
If you're teaching someone to use this system, walk through one example turn-by-turn to show:
- What good questions look like
- How to evaluate presented options
- When to approve vs. request changes
- How to maintain creative control while leveraging AI expertise

---

## 🔍 **Common Patterns Across All Examples**

### Turn 1-2: **Understand Before Acting**
- Agent reads context (design docs, specs, constraints)
- Agent asks clarifying questions
- No assumptions or guesses

### Turn 3-5: **Present Options with Reasoning**
- 2-4 distinct approaches
- Pros/cons for each
- Theory/precedent supporting the analysis
- Recommendation made, decision deferred to user

### Turn 6-8: **Iterate on Drafts**
- Show work incrementally
- Incorporate feedback immediately
- Flag edge cases or ambiguities proactively

### Turn 9-10: **Approval and Completion**
- "May I write to [file]?"
- User: "Yes"
- Agent writes files
- Agent offers next steps (tests, review, integration)

---

## 🚀 **Try It Yourself**

After reading these examples, try this exercise:

1. Pick one of your game systems (combat, inventory, progression, etc.)
2. Ask the relevant agent to design or implement it
3. Notice if the agent:
   - ✅ Asks clarifying questions upfront
   - ✅ Presents options with reasoning
   - ✅ Shows drafts before finalizing
   - ✅ Requests approval before writing files

If the agent skips any of these, remind it:
> "Please follow the collaborative protocol from docs/COLLABORATIVE-DESIGN-PRINCIPLE.md"

## Collaboration Protocol

**User-driven collaboration, not autonomous execution.**
Every task follows: **Question -> Options -> Decision -> Draft -> Approval**

- Agents MUST ask "May I write this to [filepath]?" before using Write/Edit tools
- Agents MUST show drafts or summaries before requesting approval
- Multi-file changes require explicit approval for the full changeset
- No commits without user instruction

See `docs/COLLABORATIVE-DESIGN-PRINCIPLE.md` for full protocol and examples.

# Upgrading Claude Code Game Studios

This guide covers upgrading your existing game project repo from one version
of the template to the next.

**Find your current version** in your git log:
```bash
git log --oneline | grep -i "release\|setup"
```
Or check `README.md` for the version badge.

---

## Table of Contents

- [Upgrade Strategies](#upgrade-strategies)
- [v0.2.0 → v0.3.0](#v020--v030)
- [v0.1.0 → v0.2.0](#v010--v020)

---

## Upgrade Strategies

There are three ways to pull in template updates. Choose based on how your
repo is set up.

### Strategy A — Git Remote Merge (recommended)

Best when: you cloned the template and have your own commits on top of it.

```bash
# Add the template as a remote (one-time setup)
git remote add template https://github.com/Donchitos/Claude-Code-Game-Studios.git

# Fetch the new version
git fetch template main

# Merge into your branch
git merge template/main --allow-unrelated-histories
```

Git will flag conflicts only in files that both the template *and* you have
changed. Resolve each one — your game content goes in, structural improvements
come along for the ride. Then commit the merge.

**Tip:** The files most likely to conflict are `CLAUDE.md` and
`.claude/docs/technical-preferences.md`, because you've filled them in with
your engine and project settings. Keep your content; accept the structural changes.

---

### Strategy B — Cherry-pick specific commits

Best when: you only want one specific feature (e.g., just the new skill, not
the full update).

```bash
git remote add template https://github.com/Donchitos/Claude-Code-Game-Studios.git
git fetch template main

# Cherry-pick the specific commit(s) you want
git cherry-pick <commit-sha>
```

Commit SHAs for each version are listed in the version sections below.

---

### Strategy C — Manual file copy

Best when: you didn't use git to set up the template (just downloaded a zip).

1. Download or clone the new version alongside your repo.
2. Copy the files listed under **"Safe to overwrite"** directly.
3. For files under **"Merge carefully"**, open both versions side-by-side
   and manually merge the structural changes while keeping your content.

---

## v0.2.0 → v0.3.0

**Released:** 2026-03-09
**Commit range:** `e289ce9..HEAD`
**Key themes:** `/design-system` GDD authoring, `/map-systems` rename, custom status line

### Breaking Changes

#### `/design-systems` renamed to `/map-systems`

The `/design-systems` skill was renamed to `/map-systems` for clarity
(decomposing = *mapping*, not *designing*).

**Action required:** Update any documentation, notes, or scripts that invoke
`/design-systems`. The new invocation is `/map-systems`.

### What Changed

| Category | Changes |
|----------|---------|
| **New skills** | `/design-system` (guided GDD authoring, section-by-section) |
| **Renamed skills** | `/design-systems` → `/map-systems` (breaking rename) |

### Files: Safe to Overwrite

**New files to add:**
```
.claude/skills/design-system/SKILL.md
.claude/statusline.sh
```

**Existing files to overwrite (no user content):**
```
.claude/skills/map-systems/SKILL.md      ← was design-systems/SKILL.md
.claude/skills/gate-check/SKILL.md
.claude/skills/brainstorm/SKILL.md
.claude/skills/start/SKILL.md
.claude/skills/design-review/SKILL.md
.claude/skills/project-stage-detect/SKILL.md
.claude/skills/setup-engine/SKILL.md
.claude/hooks/log-agent.sh
.claude/hooks/validate-commit.sh
README.md
docs/WORKFLOW-GUIDE.md
UPGRADING.md
```

**Delete (replaced by rename):**
```
.claude/skills/design-systems/   ← entire directory; replaced by map-systems/
```

---

### Files: Merge Carefully

#### `.claude/settings.json`

The new version adds a `statusLine` configuration block pointing to
`.claude/statusline.sh`. If you haven't customized `settings.json`, overwriting
is safe. Otherwise, add this block manually:

```json
"statusLine": {
  "script": ".claude/statusline.sh"
}
```

---

### New Features

#### Custom Status Line

`.claude/statusline.sh` displays a 7-stage production pipeline breadcrumb in
the terminal status line:

```
ctx: 42% | claude-sonnet-4-6 | Systems Design
```

In Production/Polish/Release stages, it also shows the active Epic/Feature/Task
from `production/session-state/active.md` if a `<!-- STATUS -->` block is present:

```
ctx: 42% | claude-sonnet-4-6 | Production | Combat System > Melee Combat > Hitboxes
```

The current stage is auto-detected from project artifacts, or can be pinned by
writing a stage name to `production/stage.txt`.

#### `/gate-check` Stage Advancement

When a gate PASS verdict is confirmed, `/gate-check` now writes the new stage
name to `production/stage.txt`. This immediately updates the status line for all
future sessions without requiring manual file edits.

---

### After Upgrading

1. **Delete the old skill directory:**
   ```bash
   rm -rf .claude/skills/design-systems/
   ```

2. **Test the status line** by starting a Claude Code session — you should see
   the stage breadcrumb in the terminal footer.

3. **Verify hook execution** still works:
   ```bash
   bash .claude/hooks/log-agent.sh '{}' '{}'
   bash .claude/hooks/validate-commit.sh '{}' '{}'
   ```

---

### Files: Merge Carefully

These files contain both template structure and your project-specific content.
Do **not** overwrite them — merge the changes manually.

#### `CLAUDE.md`

The template version was slimmed from ~159 lines to ~60 lines. The key
structural change: 5 doc imports were removed because they're auto-loaded
by Claude Code anyway (agent-roster, skills-reference, hooks-reference,
rules-reference, review-workflow).

**What to keep from your version:**
- The `## Technology Stack` section (your engine/language choices)
- Any project-specific additions you made

**What to adopt from the new version:**
- Slimmer imports list (drop the 5 redundant `@` imports if present)
- Updated collaboration protocol wording

#### `.claude/docs/technical-preferences.md`

If you ran `/setup-engine`, this file has your engine config, naming
conventions, and performance budgets. Keep all of it. The template version
is just the empty placeholder.

#### `.claude/docs/templates/game-concept.md`

Minor structural update — a `## Next Steps` section was added pointing to
`/map-systems`. Add that section to your copy if you want the updated
guidance, but it's not required.

#### `.claude/settings.json`

Check whether the new version adds any permission rules you want. The change
was minor (schema update). If you haven't customized your `settings.json`,
overwriting is safe.

#### Customized agent files

If you've added project-specific knowledge or custom behavior to any agent
`.md` file, do a diff and manually add the new AskUserQuestion integration
sections rather than overwriting. The change in each agent is a standardized
collaborative protocol block at the end of the system prompt.

---

### Files: Delete

These files were removed in v0.2.0. If present in your repo, you can safely
delete them — they're replaced by better-organized alternatives.

```
docs/IMPROVEMENTS-PROPOSAL.md      → superseded by WORKFLOW-GUIDE.md
docs/MULTI-STAGE-DOCUMENT-WORKFLOW.md → content merged into context-management.md
```

---

### After Upgrading

1. **Run `/project-stage-detect`** to verify the system reads your project
   correctly with the new detection logic.

2. **Run `/start`** once if you haven't used it — it now correctly identifies
   your stage and skips onboarding steps you've already done.

3. **Check `production/session-state/`** exists and is gitignored:
   ```bash
   ls production/session-state/
   cat .gitignore | grep session-state
   ```

4. **Test hook execution** — if you're on Windows, verify the new hooks run
   without errors in Git Bash:
   ```bash
   bash .claude/hooks/detect-gaps.sh '{}' '{}'
   bash .claude/hooks/session-start.sh '{}' '{}'
   ```

---

*Each future version will have its own section in this file.*

# Collaborative Design Principle

**Last Updated:** 2026-02-13

---

## 🎯 Core Philosophy

This agent architecture is designed for **USER-DRIVEN COLLABORATION**, not autonomous AI generation.

### ✅ The Right Model: Collaborative Consultant

```
Agent = Expert Consultant
User = Creative Director (Final Decision Maker)

Agents:
- Ask clarifying questions
- Research and present options
- Explain trade-offs and reasoning
- Draft proposals for review
- Wait for user approval before writing

Users:
- Make all creative and strategic decisions
- Approve or reject agent suggestions
- Direct the design vision
- Sign off before anything is written to files
```

### ❌ The Wrong Model: Autonomous Generator

```
❌ Agent creates design and writes it
❌ Agent makes decisions without user input
❌ Agent writes code without approval
❌ User just says "make a game" and waits
```

---

## 🔄 Collaborative Workflow Pattern

Every agent interaction should follow this pattern:

### Pattern: Question → Options → Decision → Draft → Approval

```
1. AGENT ASKS QUESTIONS
   Agent: "To design the crafting system, I need to understand:
          - Should recipes be discovered or learned from NPCs?
          - How punishing should failed attempts be?
          - Is there a resource cost to experimentation?"

2. USER PROVIDES CONTEXT
   User: "Recipes discovered through experimentation. Failed attempts should consume
         materials but give partial XP. We're targeting Explorers primarily."

3. AGENT PRESENTS OPTIONS WITH REASONING
   Agent: "Based on your goals, here are three approaches:

          **Option A: Full Randomized Discovery**
          - Mechanics: Try any item combo, random success chance
          - ✅ Maximum exploration reward
          - ❌ Can feel arbitrary without skill expression
          - Example games: Minecraft early, Doodle God
          - Aligns with pillars: ✅ Emergent Stories, ⚠️ Meaningful Choices (low)

          **Option B: Ingredient Hint System**
          - Mechanics: Items show 'compatible tags' when inspected
          - ✅ Rewards observation and deduction
          - ✅ Skill expression through pattern recognition
          - ❌ Less pure discovery magic
          - Example games: Potion Craft, Opus Magnum
          - Aligns with pillars: ✅ Meaningful Choices, ✅ Emergent Stories

          **Option C: Hybrid (Discovery + Hints)**
          - Mechanics: Start random, unlock hint system after X failures
          - ✅ Accessible to multiple player types
          - ✅ Rewards persistence
          - ❌ More complex to implement
          - Aligns with pillars: ✅✅ Both pillars strongly

          Which approach aligns best with your vision?"

4. USER DECIDES
   User: "Option C feels right. Let's set X = 5 failures to unlock hints."

5. AGENT DRAFTS BASED ON DECISION
   Agent: "Great. Here's a draft of the core mechanic:

          ### Core Loop
          1. Player selects 2-4 ingredients from inventory
          2. System checks against recipe database
          3. If match: Success! Recipe learned, item created, full XP
          4. If no match: Failure. Materials consumed, 25% XP gained
          5. After 5 failures on any item combo, hint system unlocks for those items
          6. Hints show ingredient 'tags' (e.g., 'Fire', 'Healing', 'Metal')

          ### Formula Proposal
          success_xp = base_xp * recipe_tier^1.5
          failure_xp = success_xp * 0.25
          hint_unlock_threshold = 5  # Failures to unlock hints

          Does this match your intent?"

6. USER REVIEWS AND REFINES
   User: "The loop looks good, but 25% XP feels too generous. Make it 15%.
         Also, let's make hint threshold scale: 5 for Tier 1 recipes, 3 for Tier 2+
         so players aren't frustrated by complex recipes."

7. AGENT UPDATES DRAFT
   Agent: "Updated:
          failure_xp = success_xp * 0.15
          hint_unlock_threshold = 5 if recipe_tier == 1 else 3

          Should I continue drafting the Edge Cases section, or would you like
          to review formulas in more detail first?"

8. USER APPROVES NEXT STEP
   User: "Formulas are good. Continue with Edge Cases."

9. [REPEAT CYCLE FOR EACH SECTION]

10. FINAL APPROVAL BEFORE WRITING
    Agent: "The full GDD draft is complete. I've covered:
           ✓ Overview, ✓ Player Fantasy, ✓ Detailed Rules, ✓ Formulas,
           ✓ Edge Cases, ✓ Dependencies, ✓ Tuning Knobs, ✓ Acceptance Criteria

           May I write this to design/gdd/crafting-system.md?"

    User: "Yes, write it."  ← ONLY NOW does file get created

11. AGENT WRITES FILE
    Agent: [Uses Write tool]
           "Created design/gdd/crafting-system.md. Would you like me to run
            /design-review to validate it against the standard?"
```

## 📋 How This Applies to Different Tasks

### 🎨 Design Tasks

**Example:** "Design the combat system"

```
❌ WRONG (Autonomous):
User: "Design the combat system"
Agent: [Writes design/gdd/combat-system.md with full design]
Agent: "Done! Here's your combat system."

✅ RIGHT (Collaborative):
User: "Design the combat system"
Agent: "I'd love to help design your combat system. First, some questions:
       1. What's the core fantasy? (precise timing? tactical positioning? resource management?)
       2. Real-time or turn-based?
       3. How much depth vs accessibility? (think Celeste vs Dark Souls)
       4. Any reference games that nail the feel you want?"

### 💻 Coding Tasks

**Example:** "Implement the damage calculation"

```
❌ WRONG:
User: "Implement damage calculation"
Agent: [Writes src/gameplay/combat/damage_calculator.gd]
Agent: "Implemented!"

✅ RIGHT:
User: "Implement damage calculation per design/gdd/combat-system.md"
Agent: [Reads design doc]
       "I see the design calls for:
        - Base damage * weapon multiplier * crit multiplier * resistance

        Before I implement, a few architectural questions:
        1. Should DamageCalculator be a static utility or a node in the scene tree?
        2. Where should weapon/resistance data live? (CharacterStats? Equipment class?)
        3. Do we need damage events for VFX/SFX hookup?

        Also, I notice the design doc doesn't specify rounding behavior.
        Should we round damage (to int) or allow decimal damage?"

User: "Static utility. Stats on CharacterStats node. Yes, emit signal on damage.
      Round damage down to int."

Agent: "Got it. Here's the proposed architecture:

       [Shows code structure]

       Does this match your expectations? Any changes before I write the code?"

User: "Looks good. Implement it."

Agent: [Writes code, runs through gameplay-code rule checks, fixes issues]
       "Implemented src/gameplay/combat/damage_calculator.gd.
        The gameplay-code rule flagged one issue: multiplier was hardcoded.
        I moved it to assets/data/combat_config.json.

        Would you like me to write tests now, or review the code first?"
```

### 🎯 Brainstorming Tasks

**Example:** `/brainstorm roguelike`

```
❌ WRONG:
User: "/brainstorm roguelike"
Skill: [Generates 1 concept and writes it to design/concept.md]

✅ RIGHT:
User: "/brainstorm roguelike"
Skill: "I'll help you brainstorm roguelike concepts using professional
       ideation frameworks. First:

       1. What excites you about roguelikes? (permadeath tension? build variety?
          skill mastery? emergent stories?)
       2. Any sub-genre? (action, deckbuilder, puzzle, tactics?)
       3. Any roguelikes you love/hate and why?
       4. Solo dev or team? (Affects scope recommendations)

       [User answers]

       Okay! I'll generate 10 raw concepts across 3 categories:
       - Traditional (combat-focused)
       - Hybrid (combat + other verb)
       - Unconventional (non-combat primary loop)

       [Generates 10 concepts with MDA analysis for each]

       Which 2-3 resonate most? I'll do deep MDA + SDT analysis on those."

User: "Concepts 3, 7, and 9 are interesting"

Skill: [Analyzes those 3 in depth]
       "Here's the deep analysis:

       Concept 3: [Full breakdown]
       Concept 7: [Full breakdown]
       Concept 9: [Full breakdown]

       Based on MDA alignment, target audience, and scope:
       **I recommend Concept 7** because [reasoning].

       But you should pick based on what excites YOU most.
       Which concept do you want to develop into your game?"

User: "Let's go with Concept 7"

Skill: "Excellent. Should I:
       A) Create the full concept document now (design/concept.md)
       B) First explore Concept 7 more (core verbs, unique hooks)
       C) Prototype a tiny vertical slice to validate the feel?"

User: "A, create the doc"

Skill: "Writing design/concept.md..."
```

## 🛠️ How Agents Should Ask Questions

### Good Question Patterns

✅ **Multiple Choice with Reasoning:**
```
"Should enemies telegraph attacks?
 A) Yes, 0.5s before (accessible, rhythm-based)
 B) Yes, 0.2s before (tight timing, skill-based)
 C) No telegraph (pure pattern learning, high difficulty)
 Which fits your vision?"
```

✅ **Constrained Options with Trade-offs:**
```
"Inventory system options:
 1. Grid-based (Resident Evil, Diablo): Deep space management, slower
 2. List-based (Skyrim, Fallout): Fast access, less strategic
 3. Hybrid (weight limit + limited slots): Medium complexity

 Given your 'Meaningful Choices' pillar, I'd lean toward #1 or #3. Thoughts?"
```

✅ **Open-Ended with Context:**
```
"The design doc doesn't specify what happens when a player dies while crafting.
 Some options:
 - Materials lost (harsh, risk/reward)
 - Materials returned to inventory (forgiving)
 - Work-in-progress saved (complex to implement)

 What fits your target difficulty?"
```

### Bad Question Patterns

❌ **Too Open-Ended:**
```
"What should the combat system be like?"
← Too broad, user doesn't know where to start
```

❌ **Leading/Assuming:**
```
"I'll make combat real-time since that's standard for this genre."
← Didn't ask, just assumed
```

❌ **Binary Without Context:**
```
"Should we have a skill tree? Yes or no?"
← No pros/cons, no reference to game pillars
```

## 🎛️ Structured Decision UI (AskUserQuestion)

Use the `AskUserQuestion` tool to present decisions as a **selectable UI** instead
of plain markdown text. This gives the user a clean interface to pick from options
(or type "Other" for a custom answer).

### The Explain → Capture Pattern

Detailed reasoning doesn't fit in the tool's short descriptions. So use a two-step
pattern:

1. **Explain first** — Write your full expert analysis in conversation text:
   detailed pros/cons, theory references, example games, pillar alignment. This is
   where the reasoning lives.

2. **Capture the decision** — Call `AskUserQuestion` with concise option labels
   and short descriptions. The user picks from the UI or types a custom answer.

### When to Use AskUserQuestion

✅ **Use it for:**
- Every decision point where you'd present 2-4 options
- Initial clarifying questions with constrained answers
- Batching up to 4 independent questions in one call
- Next-step choices ("Draft formulas or refine rules first?")
- Architecture decisions ("Static utility or singleton?")
- Strategic choices ("Simplify scope, slip deadline, or cut feature?")

❌ **Don't use it for:**
- Open-ended discovery questions ("What excites you about roguelikes?")
- Single yes/no confirmations ("May I write to file?")
- When running as a Task subagent (tool may not be available)

### Format Guidelines

- **Labels**: 1-5 words (e.g., "Hybrid Discovery", "Full Randomized")
- **Descriptions**: 1 sentence summarizing the approach and key trade-off
- **Recommended**: Add "(Recommended)" to your preferred option's label
- **Previews**: Use `markdown` field for comparing code structures or formulas
- **Multi-select**: Use `multiSelect: true` when choices aren't mutually exclusive

### Example — Multi-Question Batch (Clarifying Questions)

After introducing the topic in conversation, batch constrained questions:

```
AskUserQuestion:
  questions:
    - question: "Should crafting recipes be discovered or learned?"
      header: "Discovery"
      options:
        - label: "Experimentation"
          description: "Players discover by trying combinations — high mystery"
        - label: "NPC/Book Learning"
          description: "Recipes taught explicitly — accessible, lower mystery"
        - label: "Tiered Hybrid"
          description: "Basic recipes learned, advanced discovered — best of both"
    - question: "How punishing should failed crafts be?"
      header: "Failure"
      options:
        - label: "Materials Lost"
          description: "All consumed on failure — high stakes, risk/reward"
        - label: "Partial Recovery"
          description: "50% returned — moderate risk"
        - label: "No Loss"
          description: "Materials returned, only time spent — forgiving"
```

### Example — Design Decision (After Full Analysis)

After writing the full pros/cons analysis in conversation text:

```
AskUserQuestion:
  questions:
    - question: "Which crafting approach fits your vision?"
      header: "Approach"
      options:
        - label: "Hybrid Discovery (Recommended)"
          description: "Discovery base with earned hints — balances exploration and accessibility"
        - label: "Full Discovery"
          description: "Pure experimentation — maximum mystery, risk of frustration"
        - label: "Hint System"
          description: "Progressive hints reveal recipes — accessible but less surprise"
```

### Example — Strategic Decision

After presenting the full strategic analysis with pillar alignment:

```
AskUserQuestion:
  questions:
    - question: "How should we handle crafting scope for Alpha?"
      header: "Scope"
      options:
        - label: "Simplify to Core (Recommended)"
          description: "Recipe discovery only, 10 recipes — makes deadline, pillar visible"
        - label: "Full Implementation"
          description: "Complete system, 30 recipes — slips Alpha by 1 week"
        - label: "Cut Entirely"
          description: "Drop crafting, focus on combat — deadline met, pillar missing"
```

### Team Skill Orchestration

In team skills, subagents return their analysis as text. The **orchestrator**
(main session) calls `AskUserQuestion` at each decision point between phases:

```
[game-designer returns 3 combat approaches with analysis]

Orchestrator uses AskUserQuestion:
  question: "Which combat approach should we develop?"
  options: [concise summaries of the 3 approaches]

[User picks → orchestrator passes decision to next phase]
```
